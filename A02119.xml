            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Depending whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him for all I had: No cloathes to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my nakedneſſe, but of his making: no food to ſatisfie my hunger, but of his providing: and oh that I had continued his ſheepe ſtill, for then though weake, I ſhould have beene inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though feeble, I ſhould have been harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; Where by taking (O miſerable miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) the Serpent for a ſhepheard, I became
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16288:6"/> of an innocent Sheepe, a ravening Wolfe, and ſhould have ſo continued, at leaſt a perpetuall ſtrayer: if my true ſhepheard (O the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bowells of compaſſion) had not left the Ninetie nine in the Wilderneſſe to ſeeke after mee, and had not found mee out, and brought me back againe into his Fold; that if there be joy in Heaven, that the loſt ſheepe is found, there ought to bee much more joy in Earth, that the loſt ſheepe can ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; I ſhall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can I truly ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard;</hi> ſeeing hee hath turned me over, ſheepe and lambes and all, to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be our ſhepheard? Can he turne me over to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet himſelfe reteine a propertie in me ſtill? But is it not that there is a Hierarchie of ſhepheards? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſours, but Miniſteriall ſhepheards; God himſelfe the ſhepheard Paramount;<note place="margin">

               <hi>Hee ledd his people like ſheepe by the hand of Moſes and Aaron:</hi> Hee but uſed the ſervice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> himſelfe was the ſhepheard ſtill; it was hee that led them. And is it not ſaid of Kings too, that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Shepheards of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and perhaps <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes here, as hee was a King: for though a King be a ſhepheard in relation to his Subjects; yet he is but a ſheep in relation to God: for relation in all created things, makes <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet;</hi> a ſheepe of a ſhepheard, and a ſhepheard of a ſheepe, till
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16288:6"/> we come at God, and there Relation ceaſeth; for God being <hi>ſummum bonum, unum &amp; idem,</hi> can take no diſparagement by any relation, we are all ſheepe to him; <hi>David</hi> and Kings; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and all; All faine to ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard;</hi> or elſe, can neuer truly ſay; <hi>I ſhall not want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great happineſſe for ſheepe to have a good ſhepheard, but a greater happineſſe to have him both good and able; many ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are the one, and not the other; few are both; indeed none are both; None able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from want, but onely the ſhepheard, who is <hi>Elohim Saddai;</hi> God All-ſufficient. Kings no doubt are able ſhepheards, but yet not able to ſecure from want; for we ſee them often-times to be in want themſelves: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> an able ſhepheard, yet not ſo able, as to ſecure from want; for who knowes not what want he was in himſelfe, when time was? Wee ſhall never be ſheepe ſecure from want, till wee come to ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard;</hi> and then wee may juſtly inferre: We ſhall not want.</p>
            <p>Indeed God is a ſhepheard, as able as hee is good, and as good as he is able. <hi>For hee leadeth mee into greene paſtures.</hi> Not onely hee hath greene paſtures to lead me into, which ſhewes his Abilitie; but hee leads mee into them, which ſhewes his Goodneſſe. Hee leades me not into paſtures that are withered and drye, that would diſtaſte me before I taſte them: but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16288:7"/> he leades me into Greene paſtures, as well to pleaſe my eye with the verdure, as my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with the herbage; and inviting me as it were to eate, by ſetting out the meat in the beſt colour. A meat though never ſo good, yet if it looke not handſomely, it dulls the appetite: but when beſides the goodneſſe, it hath alſo a good looke; This gives the appetite another edge, and makes a joy before enjoying. But yet the goodneſſe is not altogether in the greenneſſe. Alas, Greene is but a colour, and colours are but deceitfull things, they might be greene leaves; or they might bee greene flags, or ruſhes: and what good were to mee in ſuch a greenneſſe? No my ſoule, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in being greene Paſtures, for now they performe as much as they promiſe; and as in being greene, they were a comfort to mee as ſoone as I ſaw them; ſo in being greene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, they are a refreſhing to me now, as ſoone as I taſt them. As they are pleaſant to looke on, ſo they are wholſome to feed on: As they are ſweet to be taſted, ſo they are eaſie to bee digeſted; that I am now me thinkes in a kind of Paradiſe, and ſeeme not to want any thing, unleſſe perhaps a little water, with which now and then to waſh my mouth, at moſt to take ſometimes a ſippe: for though ſheepe bee no great drinkers; and though their paſtures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greene, and full of ſappe, make drinke the leſſe needfull, yet ſome drinke they muſt have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16288:7"/> beſides; and now ſee the great goodneſſe of this Shepheard, and what juſt cauſe there is to depend upon his Providence: for hee lets not his ſheepe want this neither; <hi>but hee leades them beſides ſtill waters;</hi> Not waters that roare and make a noyſe, enough to fright a fearefull ſheepe: but waters ſtill and quiet, that though they drinke but little, yet they may drinke that little without feare. And may I not juſtly ſay now; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this; for is it enough, that he leade them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greene paſtures, and beſides ſtill waters? May he not leade them in, and preſently take them out againe, before their bellyes be halfe full; and ſo in ſtead of making them happy, make them more miſerable? ſet them in a longing with the ſight, and then fruſtrate them of their expectation? No my ſoule; The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this Shepheards goodneſſe, is more then ſo; Hee not onely leadeth them into greene paſtures, but hee makes them to lye downe in them; Hee leades them not in, to poſt over their meat, as if they were to eate a Paſſeover, and to take it in <hi>Tranſitu,</hi> as dogges drinke <hi>Nylus;</hi> but, <hi>hee makes them to lye downe in greene paſtures,</hi> that they may eat their fill, and feed at leiſure; and when they have done, lye downe and take their eaſe, that their After-reckoning may be as pleaſing as their Repaſt;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16288:8"/> and that they may be free from being <hi>ſolliciti de craſtino,</hi> for taking care to provide for to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, ſeeing they have a Market of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion round about them, or rather their meat ready dreſt to their hands for many dayes to come. O my ſoule, thus are the godly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, by the Lord their Shepheard; and though their paſtures may ſeeme withered, and dry in the eyes of the world; yet to them, they are greene, and pleaſing, and give more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their hearts; then theirs whoſe Corne and Wine, moſt abundantly increaſeth. And now, O my ſoule, is it not time now to ſay Grace, and to acknowledge a thankfulneſſe for this plenty of my meat, and drinke? and can I ſay a ſhortet Grace then this; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard; I ſhall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this; for if God be a Shepheard, will hee not ſheare his ſheepe? and if hee ſheare me; will he not leave me bare and naked? and how then can I ſay; I ſhall not want? God indeed is a Shepheard, that will ſheare his ſheepe; but hee will <hi>Tondere,</hi> not <hi>Deglubere;</hi> Hee will take off our old cloathes, but it is to make way for new; and he takes them off, in a time, when we may well ſpare them; indeed in a time, when it is better for us to be without them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither is his ſhearing any cauſe, but I may ſay ſtill; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16288:8"/>
            <p>And yet I ſay ſtill, there will perhaps bee want for all this: For is it enough to have food, and rayment? Is it enough to have eaſe and plenty? Alas! all theſe doe but ſerve for the body; there is no proviſion here for the ſoule: and if the ſoule be not provided for; all the reſt, is but the care of <hi>Martha,</hi> troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things, and none of them needfull. But he that told <hi>Martha</hi> of her errour, is it like he will commit the like errour himſelfe? No my ſoule, his principall care is of the ſoule; for <hi>hee reſtoreth my ſoule:</hi> but as he made mee <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> not a living ſoule at firſt, till hee had made the earth, and the fruits of the earth to ſerve for my living; ſo he Reſtores not my ſoule now, till he hath firſt ledde me into Greene paſtures, to ſerve for my ſuſtenance: for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were it to give a life, and not a living? to give a Being; and not give meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Being? and was it not perhaps from hence, that Chriſt tooke his patterne; when he taught us, to Pray for daily bread, before wee Pray for forgiveneſſe of ſinnes? But though he provide firſt for the body, which was made firſt; yet he provides moſt for the ſoule, which was given laſt: Hee but feedes my body, but he reſtores my ſoule: Hee miniſters to my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but accidentall and outward things; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſubſtantiall to my ſoule. And why is it, that God provides more for the ſoule, then for the body; but becauſe the ſoule is of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16288:9"/> farre more worth then the body? for God is not as man, to take care of things out of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or upon miſtaking: but hee takes care of things according as hee values them, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues them according as they are worth; <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid cura Deo de Bobis,</hi> Doth God take care of Oxen? Indeed the Soule, in compariſon of the Body; is of farre more value, then the worth of an Oxe, in compariſon of a man. O that wee could be ſo wiſe, as to know the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and worth of the ſoule! and to take care of things according to their values! we ſhould then certainly be more carefull of the ſoule, leſſe carefull of the body then we are: and be more ſenſible of that ſaying of Chriſt; <hi>What availes it a man, to gaine the whole world, and to loſe his ſoule?</hi> It may bee allowed perhaps to men, to provide firſt for the body, ſo they would provide moſt for the ſoule, as God doth here: but to provide firſt and moſt, for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and laſt, and leaſt for the ſoule, as moſt men doe; that I ſay not, all for the body, and nothing for the ſoule, as ſome men doe; This muſt needs be extremely againſt all good order: ſeeing it is ſo directly againſt Gods order.</p>
            <p>But to what is it that God reſtores my ſoule? It muſt be to ſomething that my ſoule had before, and hath not now: and ſo it is: Hee reſtores it, to its originall puritie, that was now growne foule, and black with ſinne: for alas,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16288:9"/> what good were it, to have greene paſtures, and a black ſoule! Hee reſtores it, to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper in affections, that was growne diſtempered with violence of Paſſions: for alas what good were it, to have ſtill waters, and turbulent ſpirits! Hee reſtores it indeed to life, that was growne before, in a manner quite dead, and who could reſtore my ſoule to life, but he onely that is the good Shepheard, and gave his life for his ſheepe, which no ſhepheard ever did but Hee? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> layd downe his life, but he gave not his life; for he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have kept it, if he might: and he layd it not downe neither, as a ſhepheard for his ſheepe, but as a ſheepe rather for his ſhepheard: but this Shepheard gave his life for his ſheepe: Gave it, <hi>quia oportuit</hi> indeed, becauſe it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould give it; but yet, <hi>quia voluit</hi> too, becauſe hee would giue it; for if it had not beene voluntarie, it could not have beene acceptable; and if not acceptable, never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have ſerved for a Ranſome; and if not Ranſomming, no Reſtoring.</p>
            <p>But is it not ſaid, The Shepheard was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the ſheepe were ſcattered? and what was his ſmyting, but the Giving his life? and had he not done better to have kept his life, then leaving it, to leave his ſheepe to ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? O my ſoule, though they were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a time, yet it was but to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe with the greater joy: for though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16288:10"/> he left his life, yet he left not his ſheepe: but had a care of them, even in death; for hee had power to lay downe his life, and power to take it up againe: and as he layd it downe for his ſheepes Ranſome, ſo hee tooke it up for their juſtification.</p>
            <p>Every ſhepheard knowes that ſheepe are ſubject to many infirmities, and knowes many infirmities to which they are ſubject; and therefore is never without his Boxe of Tarre, as the beſt remedie in caſes of danger; but if the danger paſſe his Tarre-boxe, and touch upon the life; he then gives them over, and lets nature worke: but the Lord is a Shepheard of another nature, above the power of Nature; He reſtoreth the ſoule, when the life is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; hee hath wayes of curing, which no ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard knows of but himſelfe; and if other helps fayle, he need but to ſay, <hi>Velo, ſis ſanus; I will, Be thou whole:</hi> and without any Tarre-boxe, it is a preſent remedie. And may I not now juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard; I ſhall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this: for is it enough, that he reſtore my ſoule, and then leave me? What is it to reſtore my ſoule, but to put it <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> in the ſtate it was made at firſt; which, was after the Image of God in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe? and if I could not continue in this ſtate, when made in it, how ſhall I continue in it, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16288:10"/> to it? Hee will therefore ſupply this want too: for having reſtored my ſoule in righteouſneſſe; <hi>Hee will leade mee in the paths of righteouſneſſe:</hi> that though left to my ſelfe, I tooke a wrong guide, and went aſtray; yet when he leades me, that is the way it ſelfe; I may be ſure, I cannot poſſibly goe out of the way.</p>
            <p>But alas, O Lord, theſe paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, have a long time ſo little beene frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all prints of a path, are almoſt cleane worne out; that it is a hard matter now but to find where the paths lye, and if wee can find them, yet they are ſo narrow, and ſo full of rubbes; that without ſpeciall aſſiſtance, it is an impoſſible thing, not to Fall, or goe aſtray. Even ſome Angels, and thoſe no meane ones, were not able to goe right in theſe pathes of righteouſneſſe; but for want of leading, went awry, and periſhed. O therefore, Thou the great Shepheard of my ſoule, as thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of thy grace to leade me into them; ſo vouchſafe with thy Grace to leade me in them: for though in themſelves they bee pathes of righteouſneſſe; yet to me, they will bee but paths of errour, if thou vouchſafe not, as well to leade me in them, as into them. O the comfortable pathes of righteouſneſſe; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paths in which <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and which walked in as they ſhould be, will bring us to a better Paradiſe, then that of our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16288:11"/> firſt Parents. For if God leade us in theſe paths; theſe paths will leade us to the place, where the Goats ſhall be put on the left hand, and the ſheepe be taken on the right, that now I am certainly come to the higheſt cauſe of my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to ſay; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want:</hi> for at his right hand is the fulneſſe of Joy forevermore.</p>
            <p>But why is it, that this great Shepheard will doe theſe great things for me? Is it becauſe he findes me to be a ſounder ſheepe, and to have fewer blemiſhes upon me then ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Alas no; for I am nothing but blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and unſoundneſſe all over; but, <hi>Hee will doe it for his Names ſake;</hi> For ſeeing hee hath taken upon him the Name of a good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, he will diſcharge his part, what ever his ſheepe be: It is not their being bad ſheepe, that can make him leave being a good ſhepheard, but he will be good, and maintaine the credit of his Name, in ſpight of all their badneſſe: and though no benefit come to them of it, yet there ſhall glory accrew to him by it, and his Name ſhall nevertheleſſe be magnified, and extolled.</p>
            <p>But now, O my ſoule, though I can ſay, I ſhall not want: yet can I ſay, I ſhall not feare? For is not Feare an inſeparable companion of Mortalitie? and can I then chooſe but feare, that know my ſelfe to be mortall, and know alſo what the condition is of being mortall?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16288:11"/> Not onely that I may dye, but that I muſt dye: and not onely muſt one day, but may this day; Alas, this very minute! I feare indeed when I conſider my owne frailtie: but when I conſider that the Lord is my Shepheard, I then am armed againſt all feare, againſt this feare of death it ſelfe: Hee that makes me to walke in Greene paſtures, and in paths of righteouſneſſe, and keepes me from want: hee alſo leades me by the hand, as I walke, and keepes me from feare: <hi>Yea, thou I walke in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> valley, of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no evill:</hi> Though I be brought to never ſo great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: though brought as low as the Valley of death, though brought as neere to Death, as the ſhadow to the body; though brought to walke as a ghoſt amongſt the dead, yet I will feare no evill. The ſhadow of death may perhaps be farre enough from it, for all our life, is but the ſhadow of death: but the Valley of the ſhadow muſt needs be cloſe to death, as being the very entrance to it; yet if I were brought to this doore of death, if brought within the doore, and compaſſed about with Death; yet for all this, for all that can be ſaid, or done, I will feare no evill. Will you not? will you not feare evill, when the evill is ſo eminent, and the danger ſo great? Is the face of Death no more terrible, but that you dare looke upon it, without feare? Though it be the reproach of the wicked, to feare where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16288:12"/> there is no cauſe of feare, yet not to feare where there is cauſe, can be no commendation in the godly. And why then will <hi>David</hi> ſpeake thus, more like a deſperate man, then one that were well adviſed? No doubt, <hi>David</hi> will give good reaſon for that hee ſpeakes; As it were deſperatneſſe, not to feare, where there is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger: So it were cowardiſe to feare, where there is eminent comfort: Lay then the comfort to the danger, and you will eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>David,</hi> for fearing no evill. You have ſeene the Danger, now heare the Comfort: <hi>The Lord my ſhepheard is with mee;</hi> For he is never abſent from his flock: <hi>his rodde, and his ſtaffe, they comfort mee:</hi> and may they not juſtly comfort me, when with them he is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a ſheepe, though falling downe the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt Praecipyce, or though already in the Wolfes mouth, or in the pawes of the Lyon. Indeed, if I had not my Shepheard with mee; Or if my Shepheard had not his inſtruments with him, I might juſtly then be in feare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; but what evill can I feare now, when I have my Shepheard, and my Shepheard his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; <hi>his rod, and his ſtaffe;</hi> Both Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of comfort; and not onely of comfort, but of incouragement; both Inſtruments of preſerving.</p>
            <p>But is it well underſtood, what his Rod, and his Staffe meane? For, they may as well bee inſtruments of correcting, as defending: and if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16288:12"/> of defending, there is then juſt cauſe they ſhould be comforts: but if of correcting, what comforts can they be? for what comfort can it be, to be corrected? O my ſoule, great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me, that know the nature of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, as I doe: for doe not I know, that whom he loves, he corrects; and therefore whom he corrects, it is a certaine Argument that hee loves? Indeed, if the Rodde and the Staffe, were in the hands of an enemie; I ſhould then feare them, as inſtruments for my evill; but being in his hands that is my Shepheard; now they are but as my owne weapons put into an abler hand, that can better manage them for my good, then I could doe my ſelfe. Could <hi>Moſes</hi> with his rod fetch water out of a Rock, and ſhall not God with his rod, bring comfort out of trouble? Could <hi>Jacob</hi> with his ſtaffe paſſe over Jordan, and returne enriched with heards of cattell, and ſhall not Gods ſtaffe make me paſſe over the Jordan of this world, and bring mee home with troopes of joy? Shall not his rod, though it wound me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me; when I know he wounds, but to the end hee may apply a Plaiſter? Shall not his ſtaffe, though it beat me, comfort me; when it is but to beat the duſt out of mee, that am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but duſt? But moſt of all, muſt not his rod needs comfort me, when it is his rod, that makes me lye downe in greene paſtures? Muſt not his ſtaffe needs comfort me, when it is his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16288:13"/> ſtaffe, that keepes me right in the paths of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe? Oh ſweet Rod, how can I chooſe but kiſſe thee! Deare ſtaffe, but embrace thee! ſeeing it is long of you, that his greene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and his paths of righteouſneſſe doe me any good; for they would certainly doe mee hurt; his greene paſtures would pamper up my fleſh too much; his pathes of righteouſneſſe would puffe up my ſpirits too much; If his Rod, and his Staffe were not uſed as Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. And if you thinke this ſtrange, that the paths of righteouſneſſe ſhould puffe up the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Remember Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom there was given a thorne in the fleſh, leſt his walking in the paths of righteouſneſſe, ſhould puffe him up. But if the rod, and the ſtaffe, in theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may not be ſufficient comfort to take away all cauſe of feare; at leaſt, <hi>there ſhall come forth a Rod, out of the ſtemme of Jeſſe:</hi> (indeed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in particular, a ſpeciall comfort) that will certainly be ſufficient againſt all feare, though I walke in the Valley of the ſhadow of death; for this Rod, as a Mountaine ſhall fill up all Valleys; and as the ſubſtance, ſhall fulfill all ſhadowe; and as the true life, ſhall ſwallow up Death in victory. And is there not a ſtaffe that will doe as much? the ſtaffe upon which <hi>Jacob</hi> leaned, when he was a dying? when he was indeed in the Valley of the ſhadow of Death? O my ſoule, having this Staffe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to leane upon; this Rodde of the ſtemme
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16288:13"/> of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> to be my comfort; I ſhall make my ſelfe unworthy of protection, if I ſhould feare any evill, though I walke in the valley of the ſhadow of death. For why ſhould I feare Death, which is but the parting of the ſoule from the body, ſeeing I cannot come to God with them both at once, but they muſt firſt bee parted one from another? My ſoule cannot come to the light of life, if my body bee not firſt in the ſhadow of death: indeed but in the ſhadow, for the ſubſtance of death can never take hold upon it, if my ſoule be gone before to take poſſeſſion of the Light. O then vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, O God, to bring my ſoule firſt, and after it, my body out of the ſhadow of Death, into the light of Life; and then I ſhall have cauſe, juſt cauſe to ſay, and to glory in ſaying; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be doubted ſtill, how it can be, that Gods rodde, and his ſtaffe, ſhould be comforts to the godly, then marke the iſſue, and ſee what followes upon his Rod, and his Staffe; <hi>Thou prepareſt a Table before mee, in the preſence <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> of my enemies: Thou anoynteſt my head with Oyle; my cuppe runneth over.</hi> For this is a ſure rule with God, that his chaſtening alwayes ends in cheriſhing; if he ſtrike with his Rod, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps breakes the head with his Staffe; he gives Oyle preſently to anoynt it, and to make it whole againe. If he make mee to keepe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting-day to day, he allowes mee a feaſt for it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16288:14"/> to morrow, and then my cuppe ſhall runne over.</p>
            <p>Hitherto God hath vouchſafed to bee a Shepheard, and <hi>David</hi> hath beene his ſheepe; Now God will be a Conquerour, and <hi>David</hi> ſhall be a King. Now God as a Conquerour will beſtow favours on his friends, and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon his enemies, and therefore now the Scene alters: where it was before in the field, it is now within doores; and where <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake in the third Perſon, he ſpeakes now in the ſecond; <hi>Thou prepareſt a Table before mee;</hi> and this is to feaſt his friends: <hi>In the preſence of mine enemies;</hi> and this is to confound his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. To prepare a Table before him, is it ſelfe a favour: but the greatneſſe of the favour is in this, that a Table is prepared before him, in the preſence of his Enemies. For as there is no ſuch joy of proſperitie to the godly, as when their enemies ſee the proſperitie they are in; it being a kind of revenge, that God takes upon their enemies, in their behalfe: ſo there is no ſuch Tragedie to the wicked, as to be made ſpectatours of the proſperitie of the godly; it being the greateſt affront, that can be to their expectation, to ſee them advanced, whom they both hated, and deſpiſed. Could <hi>Haman</hi> have had a greater affliction, then to ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> advanced, and himſelfe forced to bee an inſtrument in his advancing? <hi>Videbunt quem transfixerunt, They ſhall ſee him, whom they pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:16288:14"/> ſhall be one of the miſeries, and perhaps one of the greateſt in Hell it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And now is <hi>David</hi> a King, and as a King, hath Honour and Plentie; <hi>Thou anoynteſt my head with oyle,</hi> This is his Honour; <hi>My cuppe runneth over,</hi> This is his Plentie: that where he ſaid before; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard; I ſhall not want:</hi> hee may as juſtly ſay now; The Lord is my rewarder; I ſhall abound.</p>
            <p>But is it not that in the Perſon of <hi>David</hi> here, there is a Reference to Chriſt himſelfe; ſeeing it is all verefied in him, that is ſpoken here? Hee that hungred ſo long, till Sathan thought he could have eaten ſtones, hath now a Table prepared before him; a Table where the godly ſhall ſit, and eat with him in his Kingdome. Hee that had enemies inſulting over him; hath now all his enemies made his foot-ſtoole; Sinne and Death, Sathan and his members, lye proſtrate under him: Hee that had his Head pricked with thornes, hath now his Head anoynted with Oyle: with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes. Hee that thirſted, and could get but Vinegar to drinke, hath now ſuch plenty, that his cup runneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: All power is given him, both in Heaven and Earth. At leaſt in the perſon of <hi>David,</hi> there will be relation to all the godly: Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> that could not get ſo much as crummes from <hi>Dives</hi> his Table, ſhall have a Table him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe prepared before him: Now <hi>Dives</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16288:15"/> fared deliciouſly every day, ſhall bee glad to ſtand waiting at <hi>Lazarus</hi> Table, for a drop of water: that the godly may well be content to be in penurie a-while, ſeeing they ſhall have a Table ere long prepared before them: They may well be content to let their Enemies bee maſters awhile, ſeeing they ſhall have them ere long to be wayters upon them: They may well be content to hang downe their heads for awhile, ſeeing their heads ere long ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with Oyle: They may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have hard meaſure for a time, ſeeing the time will be ſhortly, that their Cup ſhall runne over. And now, O my ſoule, will not all this ſerve to comfort thee, in this vale of miſerie? Art thou ſo beſotted on things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to have no conſideration, to make no valuation of things to come, and to come ſo ſhortly? ſo ſhortly all, that they are put in the Preſent tenſe, as if they were come already?</p>
            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> cannot over-rule thee as a King, let him at leaſt perſwade thee as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; for now you ſhall have him a Prophet, and a Votarie, and this is his Prophecie; <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mercy, and goodneſſe, ſhall follow mee, all the dayes of my life:</hi> and this is his Vow; <hi>I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is <hi>Davids</hi> Prophecie like to bee true? will Mercie, and Goodneſſe, follow him all the dayes of his life? O my ſoule, it was true in <hi>David,</hi> it ſhall be true in all the godly: for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16288:15"/> whom God loveth, he loveth to the end; and Mercie, and Goodneſſe, ſhall follow them all the dayes of their life: Mercy, to commiſerate; and Goodneſſe to relieve: Mercie to beare with infirmities, and Goodneſſe to ſupply wants: Mercie to be an aſſiſtant in Adverſitie, and Goodneſſe to be a Governeſſe in Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Alas! O Lord, if thy Mercie ſhould not follow me, thy Juſtice would: if thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould not follow mee, thy Vengeance would; and then one that were no Prophet, might eaſily foretell the miſerable eſtate I ſhould be in: as now that Mercie and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe follow me; one that is no Prophet may eaſily tell the happy condition I ſhall be in. Although this perhaps be not ſo much a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, as a Faith in <hi>David,</hi> at leaſt a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which all the godly may make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Faith, to be aſſured of the mercy and goodneſſe of God; and not to follow them for a time, and then give over, but to follow them all the dayes of their life. But what? no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then all the dayes of their life, and then leave them? No my ſoule, but all the dayes of that life, that ſhall never leave them. O the comfortable doctrine of Faith! farre more comfortable then Heathen Philoſophie ever knew; for that went no further, then <hi>Ante obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nemo;</hi> as though no man could be happy till his death; where by this it appeares that men may bee happy while they live: for if a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16288:16"/> man be then happy, when the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God follow him, as certainly a greater happineſſe there cannot be: then ſeeing they ſurely follow the godly, all the dayes of their life; ſurely a godly man is happy while hee lives. But then the ſureneſſe is long of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not of the man: for it ſeemes he would goe farre enough from it, if Mercy did not follow him: but now that hee is followed by Mercy and Goodneſſe, hee cannot goe ſo faſt from them, but they will overtake him, and make him happy. O mercifull God, ſo frame my heart, that I may not flye from thy Mercy, and put it to follow mee; at leaſt let it ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, that it may overtake me: for then I ſhall have the happineſſe to bee able to keepe my vow, that <hi>I will dwell in thy houſe for ever:</hi> but rather I ſhall have the favour, as an effect of thy Mercy, that <hi>I ſhall dwell in thy houſe for ever.</hi> For if this be a Vow, it is a ſtrange one, where all the benefit is to him that makes the Vow, and none at all to whom it is made, for what is it to God, whither I dwell in his houſe or no? ſuch Vowers God may have enow. O my ſoule, to vow to dwell in Gods houſe, is to vow to be his ſervant; and to bee his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is to ſerve him in holineſſe, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, all the dayes of our life; and though this ſervice be no benefit to God, as indeed no more is any thing I can doe, for my goodneſſe extendeth not to him: yet the Vow to bee his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16288:16"/> ſervant being well performed, will bee more acceptable to him, then if I ſhould vow as <hi>Jepthe</hi> did, to ſacrifice his onely Daughter.</p>
            <p>But wee need not ſtand to juſtifie <hi>Davids</hi> Vow: for it ſeemes not ſo much a Vow of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to God; as a favour of God to <hi>David,</hi> that when his mercy hath followed him all the dayes of his life, he will take him afterwards to live with himſelfe; and though his body for a time be caſt out of doores, yet his ſoule ſhall preſently be received into his houſe, there to dwell with him and his Angels; not as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but as ſonne; ſeeing none but ſonnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the houſe for ever. Which in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>David,</hi> is no leſſe the Portion, and may be as well the comfort of all the godly, and is but the expreſſing of that in a higher ſtraine; which was ſaid at firſt in a lower ſtyle; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard: I ſhall not want.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ight which makes all things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>1</label> was the firſt made, of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things: and whether God did it, for our example or no, I know not: but ever ſince, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of this manner of Gods proceeding; the firſt thing we doe, when wee intend to doe any thing, is to get us Light. Indeed Light, is not onely a directour, but a comforter: and nothing naturally ſtrikes ſo much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as Darkneſſe: for when wee are in the darke, not onely wee are apt to take into our fancies, all frightfull objects, but we know not how to take our ſteps, for feare of walls, and threſholds. It is every ones caſe, to have the Sunne for his light; but it is not every ones happineſſe, to have God for his Light; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16288:20"/> alas, if I ſhould truſt to the Sunne for light, I ſhould be left in darkneſſe, every day, at leaſt at night: but God is a Sunne that never ſets: hee is Light himſelfe, hee is Light it ſelfe: and therefore it is good truſting to God for Light: for ſo I ſhall be ſure, neither day nor night, to be left in darkneſſe. O thou great Creatour of Light; Thou Light of all creatures, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſhine upon me, and to lighten my dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that neither any Objects of terrour may make mee to tremble; nor any Threſholds of errour may make mee to ſtumble, but that I may walke ſecurely in the confidence of this; <hi>The Lord is my Light:</hi> for of what then, of whom now, ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But, is it enough that God bee my Light? what if I my ſelfe be blind? what good then will his Light doe mee? It is true; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> ſtayes not here; but, <hi>Deus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio mea; God is my Enlightening too.</hi> Hee is both my Light, and my ſight: my Light, by which to ſee; and my ſight, with which to ſee my Light, to make walls, and threſholds viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and my ſight, to make me able to avoide them. If it were not for Light, I ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the darke; if it were not for ſight, I ſhould bee darke my ſelfe: No illumination without both: and never both, but onely from God. There is one indeed, who hath gotten him a Name, to be called <hi>Lucifer;</hi> as though it were hee, that brought us Light: when God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16288:20"/> knowes but for him, we ſhould have had no darkneſſe: yet he pretends to both; both to Light, and to enlightning: but alas, his light is but impoſture; his enlightning, but illuſion: for as he can transforme himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light; ſo he can transforme the light it ſelfe, and make it ſeeme light, when it is indeed darke: and therefore his light can never make Walls and Threſholds to be truly viſible: and as little can his enlightening, make us able to avoide them. For this was tryed in our firſt Parents, who upon his Enlightening, had their eyes opened indeed, but opened to ſee Good and Evill; not to diſtinguiſh good from evill, and therefore could not enable them, cannot us, to avoid the evill. But as they, that follow his light, doe ſtumble and fall at the Threſhold of errour; ſo they that are led by his enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, doe run their heads againſt the Walls of impietie; No avoiding of Walls and Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds; No ſhunning the ſnares of Sathan, the illuſions of this <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but onely by ſaying, if truly ſaying; <hi>Deus illuminatio mea,</hi> God is my enlightening; and then we may ſafely inferre, of what; of whom ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>David</hi> might well ſay; <hi>Deus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio mea; God is my Enlightening:</hi> Seeing God had enlightened him, not onely to ſee, but to be a Seer, which is a Prophet: but what is this to us, who are farre from any ſuch enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſee as Prophets? O my ſoule, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16288:21"/> for us; that Chriſt is the great Seer, in whoſe Light, wee ſhall ſee light: and though <hi>David</hi> were of the Jewes, and wee bee of the Gentiles; yet as Chriſt was the glory of his people Iſrael: ſo he is a Light, to lighten the Gentiles: and therefore <hi>Deus illuminatio mea, God is my enlightening;</hi> as fit for us to ſay, as it was for <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth Gods enlightening ſerve onely for a ſafeguard againſt Walls and Threſholds? Alas! the light of the Sunne, and the enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of Nature would ſerve to doe this: and what need we then to ſeeke any other? O my ſoule, there are ſpirituall Walls, and Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, which no Sunne can make us ſee, which Nature her ſelfe is not able to ſee; onely Gods enlightening, hath the influence to doe it. There is a Wall of ſinne, the Partition Wall betweene God and us: the Wall that barres us from having acceſſe to God: and this Wall, the naturall man ſees not, neither can ſee: Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination onely makes it viſible. There is a Threſhold of pride in the heart of man; a ſwelling of ſelfe-love, that lyes in the way wee are to paſſe, and is a cauſe of ſtumbling if not avoyded: and this Threſhold the naturall man ſees not, neither can ſee; onely Gods illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination makes able to ſee it. And many other Walls and Threſholds there are, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Illumination can never be ſeene; and not ſeene, can never be avoided; and not avoided,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16288:21"/> are cauſe of falling into endleſſe perdition. And as Illumination makes us to ſee theſe lights of Terrour, ſo it makes us to ſee alſo ſights of Comfort; It makes us ſee Death lye dead before us, and ſwallowed up in Victory; It makes us ſee the powers of Hell aſtoniſhed, as not able to endure the luſtre of this Light: It makes us ſee the doores of Heaven open, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which by vertue of this Light wee have meanes to enter: It makes us ſee him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, God himſelfe that is our enlightening, in whoſe Preſence, is the fulneſſe of Joy for evermore; and of whom then, of what now ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>Theſe indeed bee comfortable ſights, but what comfort for me to ſee them, if I bee not ſure I ſhall enjoy them? and how can I be any more ſure to enjoy them, then the Angells that fell? For they had Illumination, in a greater meaſure then I can hope to have it; and yet for all their Illumination, they ſtumbled at the Threſhold of Pride: and ranne their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall of ſinne, and utterly loſt; Alas have loſt for ever, all benefit, of all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſights. All this is true, and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſtayes not here neither; but <hi>Deus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio mea, &amp; ſalus mea; God is my enlightening, and my ſalvation too,</hi> and this hee was not to the Angels that fell: hee left them at Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, never conducted them to ſalvation; for if hee had done this, their Illumination had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16288:22"/> never beene turned into darkneſſe; either they had not ſtumbled at all. or at leaſt not ſo ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as to fall. If God were onely my illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I ſhould by that light goe to <hi>Video meliora probo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>,</hi> but ſhould preſently follow it with <hi>Deteriora ſequor:</hi> but when he is my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; this makes me breake off at <hi>Deteriora ſequor:</hi> and where God was heard to ſay; <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio tua ex te O Iſrael,</hi> Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelfe, O Iſrael: Now to heare him ſay, <hi>Ego autem ſalus tua,</hi> but I am thy ſalvation. If my illumination reflected upon my ſelfe, to make me ſeeme bright in my owne eyes, as though I had ſomething which I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then indeed I ſhould bee in the caſe of the Angels that fell; for ſo did they: but now that my illumination reflects upon God: and makes me ſee all goodneſſe to be originally in him, none in my ſelfe, but what he is pleaſed to impart, or impute unto me; Now Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation becomes a ſtep to ſalvation, and as they are free indeed whom the Spirit frees; ſo they are ſafe indeed, whom God ſaves; and of what then, of whom now, ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But though God be my ſalvation: yet this perhaps may be onely in the life to come, and if it be no more but ſo, I may doe ill enough in this preſent life, for all his ſalvation in the next; and have I not cauſe then to bee afraid? To free thee therefore of this ſcruple; <hi>David</hi> ſtayes not here neither; but, <hi>God is my ſalvation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16288:22"/> and the ſtrength of my life too;</hi> Not onely of my life to come, which will be ſtrong of it ſelfe, but of my preſent life, which hath no ſtrength but in him. Or rather ſeeing godlineſſe hath the promiſe of both lifes, both of this life, and the life to come, the firſt ſhall be firſt ſerved; and then if God be the ſtrength of my preſent life, there ſhall be in it no preſent weakneſſe: and if no weakneſſe, there need bee no feare; and of what then; of whom now, ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But though Gods ſtrength be ſufficient to defend me, if I had no enemies: Or if I were to fight but a ſingle combat, yet can it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve me, when an Army of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aſſaults me at once? and can I chooſe but feare, when I know my ſelfe unable to reſiſt? O my ſoule, take heed thou be not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, to whom it was ſaid; <hi>What feare yee, O yee of little faith?</hi> For what can an Army doe, againſt the arme of God? What can all Might do, againſt him that is Almightie? Have my enemies any ſtrength, but what they have from God? And can they have any ſtrength from him, againſt me, when hee employes his ſtrength againſt them for me? No my ſoule; <hi>though an hoſt encampe againſt mee; though warre bee made upon mee;</hi> yet as long as God is the ſtrength of my life, it is neither their multitude, nor their malice that can hurt mee; but rather their very malice is the meanes, their multitude
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16288:23"/> cannot hurt me, for Malice hinders Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes them, they cannot ſee their way; that when they came upon mee, and thought they had me ſure enough; even then I was ſure enough from their having: For hee that is the ſtrength of my life, had layd a block in their way, which for want of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they ſaw not, at which they ſtumbled, and fell.</p>
            <p>But yet, it is a grievous thing to have Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls for ones enemies, and ſuch my enemies ſeeme to be: They ſeeke not more to deſtroy mee, then devoure mee: They came upon mee to eat up my fleſh, as if I had beene their ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; It is not enough they could kill mee, but they could find in their hearts to eat me: They are not ſatisfied with procuring my death, if they bee not themſelves actours in it: It is not enough for them to have my bloud, unleſſe their owne hands be imbrued in it: Indeed there is no ſuch daintie diſh to a malicious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, as the fleſh of an enemy; it goes downe without chewing, and they ſwallow it up whole like Cormorants. But though Malice have a ravenous ſtomack, yet ſhe hath but ſlow diſgeſtion; though her teeth be ſharpe, yet her feet are lame, at leaſt apt to ſtumble, and this made well for <hi>David,</hi> for when his enemies came upon him, to eate up his fleſh, becauſe they came upon the feet of malice, they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell. A man may ſtumble, and yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16288:23"/> not fall, but to ſtumble, and fall withall, is the proper ſtumbling of the wicked, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the maliciouſly wicked: and ſuch, it ſeemes was the ſtumbling of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, becauſe his enemies were ſuch; and ſuch I doubt not ſhall bee the ſtumbling of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe mine are ſuch: and of what then, of whom now, ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But to the end I may have ſome exerciſe for my illumination, that it ſtand not idle; and may have ſome teſtimonie for my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it grow not doubtfull; <hi>There is one <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> thing I have deſired of the Lord, and that I will ſeeke after; that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, all the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lord: and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> This beholding of Gods beauty, will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exerciſe for my Illumination; and this enquiring in Gods holy Temple, will give me aſſurance of my ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It were very hard, if <hi>David</hi> making but one requeſt to God, that God ſhould deny him? for hath he not bidden us to aske, and wee ſhould have? and could <hi>David</hi> aske leſſe, then to aske but one thing? No my ſoule: God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it not to <hi>David,</hi> nor will deny it to thee, nor to any other that ſhall aske it in Faith: and ſpecially if hee aske it to ſo good an end as <hi>David</hi> doth here; to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing <hi>David</hi> would make but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16288:24"/> to God, why would he not make a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? for alas, what a poore requeſt is this, to deſire to dwell in Gods houſe? and what to doe? but onely to ſee? and to ſee what? but onely a Beautie, a fading thing, at moſt but to enquire; and what is enquiring? but onely to heare newes; a vaine fancie; and what cauſe in any of theſe why <hi>David</hi> ſhould make it his requeſt to God? But marke, O my ſoule, what goes with it; Take altogether; <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple:</hi> And now tell mee, if there be, tell me if there can be any greater requeſt to be made? any greater cauſe to be earneſt about it? For though worldly beauty be a fading thing, yet the Beauty of the Lord ſhall continue, when the world it ſelfe ſhall fade away; and though enquiring after newes be a vaine fancie, yet to enquire in Gods Temple, is the way to learne, there is no new thing under the Sunne; and there it was that <hi>Solomon</hi> learned, that all is vanitie. Indeed this one thing that <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is in effect, that <hi>Unum neceſſarium</hi> that Chriſt ſpeakes of in the Goſpell; which <hi>Mary</hi> made choyce of there, as <hi>David</hi> doth here; and I may ſay, it is that pretious Jewell, which the rich Merchant ſold all he had to buy, and had his bargaine commended by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. O how happy were wee, if we could bound our deſires within the compaſſe of things neceſſerie: for all our miſerie growes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16288:24"/> from this, that our deſires have no certaine dwelling, but wander and range about from one object to another, like vagabonds from place to place; and no helpe there will be for it, till our deſire arrive at that which is the beſt: for as long as there is any better to be had, the Deſire will never leave deſiring; and where is that beſt to be had, but in him onely, that is onely good: in him indeed that is the onely good: and ſeeing there can be no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe till the Deſire be ſettled; and the Deſire will never be ſettled, till wee come at God; therefore no meanes ſo likely to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to dwell in Gods houſe; for there wee are ſure we ſhall be with him; and once with him, never have deſire to any thing beſides him.</p>
            <p>There are other houſes, which in worldly conſiderations, and to worldly mindes, may ſeeme as convenient, and perhaps be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to dwell in, then this houſe of God: but that which makes me ſo deſirous to dwell here, rather then any where elſe, is partly for the proſpect, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord; and partly for inſtruction, that I may enquire in his holy Temple. For there is not ſuch a Proſpect againe in the world as this; Not on the Mount, where Chriſt was ſhewed all the Kingdomes of the earth, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them: Nor ſuch another place for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as here; Not all the Schooles of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16288:25"/> Philoſophers; Not all the Oracles of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, in any degree to be compared with it.</p>
            <p>And what then is this beauty of God, which <hi>David</hi> is ſo deſirous to behold? what this houſe of God, in which he deſires to dwell? There is a beauty of God in his creatures, moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeed, and moſt worthy of beholding: but yet this needs no dwelling in Gods houſe to ſee it; wee may ſee it as well, dwelling any where elſe; but there is a beauty of God in himſelfe, a beauty which if once we ſee, wee ſhall never be willing to take our eyes off; a beauty which the more wee ſee, the more we ſhall ſee cauſe to deſire to ſee it; a Beauty, which without ſpeciall illumination, neither the eyes of men are able to behold; nor the tongues of Angels to expreſſe; and this Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no where to be ſeene, but in Gods houſe; and not there neither, but by dwelling in it: It is not for every one that comes in as a ſtranger, to ſee this Beauty, they muſt be dwellers in it; continuall, and conſtant frequenters of it, or they are never like to be admitted to behold it. There is indeed, in all the creatures of God, in ſome more eminently, a certaine tincture of this Beauty, and is perhaps that which deceives us in the eſtimating of our happineſſe; becauſe wee take tincture for ſubſtance, and fixe our ſelves upon that which is made but onely for a paſſage. For tinctures though they pleaſe for a time, yet they ſoone weare out and decay:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16288:25"/> no ſolidneſſe, nor durableneſſe, but in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelfe, and no ſubſtance of beauty, but onely in God: and therefore the trueſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, indeed all true happineſſe, in onely the beholding of this Beauty. And if any man doubt of this, becauſe ſeeing, is but the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of one ſenſe; and happineſſe gives ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at leaſt to all the ſenſes: Let him then heare, what <hi>David</hi> in another place ſayes; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete &amp; guſtate, quam ſuavis eſt Dominus: See, and taſte, how ſweet the Lord is:</hi> For in this See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not onely the Taſting, but all the ſenſes are united, at leaſt the pleaſures of all the ſenſes are compriſed: and the rather, if wee conſider that Beholding hath a preheminence above Seeing: for where ſeeing may bee in <hi>Tranſitu</hi> onely; Beholding implyes a permanencie, and a fixing our eyes upon it; and ſuch is the See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is the Eſſentiall ſenſe of happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And what then is this houſe of God, in which <hi>David</hi> deſires to dwell? hath God any other houſe then Heaven? and would <hi>David</hi> dwell in Heaven, whilſt hee is dwelling upon Earth? will nothing ſerve his turne, but to aske God for impoſſibilities? Indeed Heaven is Gods Throne, but Heaven and Earth both, are full of the Majeſtie of his glory: and therefore God hath a Houſe on earth too; a Houſe dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the honour of his Name; and <hi>David</hi> juſtly makes his Prayer for this Houſe, becauſe indeed it is the houſe of Prayer, and no Rent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16288:26"/> payd for dwelling in it, but onely Prayer: O then make me able, O God, to pay thee this Rent, and I ſhall never doubt of continuing thy tenant in this Houſe, to behold thy Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to inquire in thy holy Temple.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould <hi>David</hi> make it a ſuite to God, to dwell in his Houſe, ſeeing God leaves the doores open, that every one may come and dwell in it that will? O my ſoule, it is not ſimply to dwell in it, but ſo to dwell in it, that he may ſee Gods beauty; and this cannot bee ſeene without illumination; and no illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Gods donation. For indeed this dwelling, is a ſpirituall living, a donative one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods gift: and juſtly therefore <hi>David</hi> makes it his ſuite, to have his Induction, but an Induction onely while wee live here; no perfect poſſeſſion till another life: but hee that ſeekes not his induction here; muſt never looke for poſſeſſion hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to behold the beauty of God, is one great benefit of dwelling in Gods houſe; ſo it is another no leſſe to inquire in his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as that beholding, gives a ſatisfaction to our eyes; ſo this inquirie to our mindes. When <hi>David</hi> ſaw the proſperitie of the wicked; hee was ſo amazed, that hee knew not what to make of it, till he entred into Gods holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and inquired: and there he preſently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what Gods meaning is in it, and why hee ſuffers it to be ſo. What knowledge ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16288:26"/> as the knowledge of ſinne? yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth hee had not knowne what ſinne is, but for the Law: and where is the Law to bee learned, but enquiring in Gods holy Temple? and indeed if there bee any ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if any doubtfulneſſe of mind, if any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of queſtion concerning either God or our ſelves; either the life preſent, or the life to come, by enquiring in Gods holy Temple, it is preſently cleered, and reſolved: for there are the Oracles kept, which ſerve to inſtruct, to teach, to reprove, that the man of God may be perfect in every good worke.</p>
            <p>And amongſt all the great myſteries which are learned by enquiring in Gods holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this is one of ſpeciall comfort to me, that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> 
               <hi>when I am in trouble,</hi> if his houſe that I dwell in, be not ſufficient to defend me; <hi>he will hide me in his owne Pavillion: in the ſecret of his Tabernacle will hee hide mee; hee will ſet mee upon a rock:</hi> that one way or other, he will bee ſure; and I may be ſure, he will ſet mee in ſafetie,</p>
            <p>But how can God hide me in his Pavillion, which lyes open to all men; and where every man may enter, and find me? He will then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faile, hide me in the ſecret of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; which is ſhut againſt all men, and where none enters but himſelfe. But yet his Tabernacle may be burnt with fire; may bee blowne up with powder; blowne downe with winde: and what ſafetie then, in the ſecret
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16288:27"/> of his Tabernacle? Hee will then, if that faile, ſet me upon a Rocke, and a Rocke is ſubject to none of theſe, that ſo at leaſt, neither fire, nor ſword, nor tempeſt of wind, may prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Or is it, that being once admitted to dwell in Gods houſe; I ſhall have, not onely the protection of a ſervant; for his <hi>Tegere,</hi> is <hi>Protegere;</hi> but the advancement alſo of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite to be ſet upon a Rocke: for this, as it is a ſafetie, is no leſſe an honour. Or is it, that leſt mine enemies ſhould thinke it were done for feare of them, that he hydes me; he will ſet me upon a Rocke, as it were in defyance: and though ſome may be ſo bold to enter the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Tabernacle; yet none will bee ſo deſperate, to venture upon a Rock, againſt which, all they can doe, is but to daſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in peeces, and to haſten their owne ruine.</p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, how canſt thou doubt of thy being in ſafetie, having the three great fortreſſes of God for thy defence: his generall providence, which is his Pavillion: then, his ſpeciall Mercie, which is the ſecret of his Tabernacle: then, the Mediation of Chriſt, who is the Rocke; upon which, when thou art ſet, neither the raging of the Sea, nor the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering of the wind, need to affright thee; for though they roare againſt thee, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt thee; and of whom then, of what now ſhould I be afraid?</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:16288:27"/>
            <p>For being ſet upon this Rock; <hi>My head ſhall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> bee lifted up above mine enemies round about mee:</hi> Though my feet may be in the water, yet my head ſhall be above water; I ſhall be in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though perhaps in ſome trouble; and in no trouble neither, but ſuch as while my head is lifted up, I may freely laugh at, and deſpiſe; and the rather, for that though my enemies be ſo many, as to be round about me; yet they are ſo meane, as to be all below mee; not meane in themſelves, but meane through him, that hath lifted up my head above them. If mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were but low, it were no great matter to be higher then they: but to have my head lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up above them, who carry their heads ſo high, as to thinke none their equalls; this muſt needs be, as well to me a cauſe of joy; as in thee, O God, an effect of power. In thy lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up my head, I regard not ſo much the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the relation to my enemies; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lifted up little, or much, it is all one to mee, ſo long as it bee above my enemies, their pitch is my proportion: for the marke of my ayme, is not ſuperiority, but ſecuritie; not to ſhine in other mens eyes, but not to have mine owne put out.</p>
            <p>There may be many cauſes of joy to a man in trouble, but none ſo great as this, to have his head lifted up above his enemies: for though to take revenge of an enemy, bee the delight onely of a cruell nature; yet to be able to take
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16288:28"/> revenge, is a joy to the mildeſt nature, but yet a joy that muſt bee made a ſacrifice, not to grow inſolent, and proud upon it; but as to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive the power with humilitie, ſo to uſe it with mildneſſe, and moſt of all, to aſcribe the glory, to whom it belongs.</p>
            <p>There was a time, O God, when thou didſt lift up mine enemies heads above me; and even then I offered thee a ſacrifice too; but it was a ſorrowfull ſacrifice, a ſacrifice of ſorrow; but when thou ſhalt lift up my head above mine enemies, I will then offer thee a joyfull ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a ſacrifice of joy: and it ſhall not bee a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent joy, as though I ſought to ſmother it, by which no glory would come unto thee; but it ſhall be a ſinging joy, and the ſong ſhall bee of thy praiſes, as ſhewing me to joy more, in thy lifting me up; then in my being lift up; more for thy glory, then for my owne advancement, but ſing I ſhall for both; I ſhall ſing, to expreſſe my joy, and I ſhall ſing to extoll thy Praiſes.</p>
            <p>But why is <hi>David</hi> ſo ſuddenly turned from ſinging to crying, that hee ſhould fall ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſay; <hi>Heare mee, O Lord, when I cry with my voyce?</hi> Is it, that hee findes God, not well pleaſed with his ſinging; and therefore meanes to try, what hee can doe with crying? Or is it, that he thinkes himſelfe better at expreſſing ſorrow then joy, and therefore hopes his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be heard, though his ſinging bee not? Or is it indeed, that ſinging, and crying both,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16288:28"/> are little enough to make a ſacrifice to God? Alas! they are both of them too little, to make an acceptable ſacrifice, without Gods mercy: and therefore <hi>David</hi> truſts not to them alone, but is glad to joyne Gods mercy with them; <hi>Have mercy alſo upon mee, O God, and anſwer mee.</hi> It is a great mercy in God to heare us, but a greater mercy to anſwer us; and therefore to require his anſwer, requires a more ſpeciall invocation of his mercy; and the rather, in hope to have a mercifull anſwer: for alas, if he ſhould anſwer, and not in mercy, ſuch an anſwer would be worſe then ſilence.</p>
            <p>But how can I doubt of Gods anſwering me, when I ſpeake to him; who have my ſelfe anſwered him, when hee ſpake to mee? For when thou ſaydſt; <hi>Seeke yee my face; my heart <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>8</label> ſaid unto thee; Thy face Lord, I will ſeeke:</hi> and for my heart to ſay it, is more then for my voyce to cry it: for no crying of the voyce, makes ſo loude a ſound in the eares of God; as the ſaying of the heart; that to uſe the termes properly, I might rather ſay; I cry it with my heart, and but ſay it with my voyce.</p>
            <p>But is this all the anſwer I ſhall have from God, that I ſhould ſeeke his face? Alas! O Lord, thy great Favourite <hi>Moſes,</hi> could never obtaine more then to ſee thy Back-parts, and how then can I hope to ſee thy face? and if I cannot hope to ſee it, why wouldſt thou have me ſpend time to ſeeke it? But is it not all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16288:29"/> one, in the phraſe of the Law, to ſeeke Gods face; as in the phraſe of the Goſpell, to ſeeke Gods kingdome? and therefore as God ſaith here; <hi>ſeeke yee my face:</hi> ſo Chriſt ſaith there; <hi>ſeeke Gods kingdome:</hi> at leaſt if they be not both one; they are both ſought one way; both ſought by following Gods Commandements, for his Commandements, if wee follow them well, will both bring us to his kingdome, and to ſee his face.</p>
            <p>Or is it not perhaps in a plaine literall ſence, that to ſeeke Gods face, is in our Prayers, and Meditations, to ſettle, and fixe the eyes of our mindes wholly upon God; and as it were, to looke him in the face: wherein, oh what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite oddes there is betweene the Angels and us, for magnifying of God: for they behold his Face, and can ſee it viſibly, where all that we can doe towards it, is onely by the ſtrength of imagination, which God knowes is but weake; very weake in us, weake in it ſelfe, and weaker for want of intention; but if we could ſee his Face as the Angels doe; O my ſoule, we ſhould ſee in it, not onely infinite cauſes for magnifying his Name; but infinite ſweetneſſe for pleaſing our owne ſenſes. For if the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a carnall face, be ſo admirable, ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as that no earthly thing may bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it; what extaſie of admiration! what tranſcendencie of pleaſure muſt needes be in the beautie of a ſpirituall Face! and ſpecially
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16288:29"/> that face, in which the fulneſſe of all Beauty reſideth bodily! And have I not cauſe then to ſeeke this Face? O mercifull God, grant me ſo to ſeeke it, that I may find it: for though this be not the place for finding it, yet this is the place for ſeeking it: and hee that ſeekes it not here; he that ſeekes it not now, is never like to find it in another place, never like to find it hereafter.</p>
            <p>But why am I ſo haſtie, to promiſe God to ſeeke his Face, as though it were in my owne power to ſeeke it at my pleaſure? Alas! how can I chooſe but promiſe it, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; and how can I thinke, when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, but that hee will enable me; at leaſt, not hinder me to performe it? and yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not performance, but Will: and Will I ſuppoſe I may ſafely promiſe, ſeeing Will is preſent with me, and can never be abſent from mee.</p>
            <p>But when I ſeeke thy face, vouchſafe, O <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>9</label> God, not to hide thy face from mee: for to what purpoſe ſhould I ſeek it, if I cannot find it? and what hope of finding it, if thou be bent to hide it? Alas! O Lord, to bid me ſeeke it, and then goe preſently and hide it from me; what were this but to mock me, as the Jewes mocked Chriſt; blindfold him, and ſtrike him; and then bid him tell, who ſtrooke him? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how ſhould I ſeeke it, if I have not light to ſeeke it by? and what light to ſeeke it by?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16288:30"/> and what light to ſeeke it by, but the light of thy Countenance? and what light of thy Countenance, if thou hide away thy face? To bid me to ſeeke thy Face, and then to hide thy Face from me, were a kind of deriſion; and I hope, O God, thou wilt not uſe me ſo unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſet me about a worke ſcarce poſſible to bee done, and then take from mee all poſſible meanes of doing it? Alas! O Lord, all the encouragement I have to ſeeke it, is the hope I have thou wilt not hide it: O therefore, <hi>Hide not thy face from mee, O God:</hi> for if thou hide thy Face from me, what can I thinke, but that thou art angry? and if indeed thou be angry, yet uſe me at leaſt as a ſervant; <hi>Put mee not away in thine anger:</hi> for though I have committed many heynous faults againſt thee, yet may I not repent, and amend them all, if thou but pleaſe, not to bee ſo haſtie with mee? what though my ſinnes have made thee angry, wilt thou therefore preſently turne me away? will no leſſe puniſhment, ſerve to appeaſe thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but to turne me preſently out of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? mayſt thou not in ſo doing, doe that in anger, which thou wilt have cauſe perhaps to be ſorry for afterwards? wilt thou not leave thy ſelfe unprovided of ſervants to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? For where are any ſuch ſervants to be found, that ſome time or other, will not give thee cauſe to bee angry? If thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Starres to ſerve thee; is there not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16288:30"/> in the Starres? If entertaine Angels to ſerve thee; Didſt thou not find folly in the Angels? Haſt thou not promiſed to conſider man, that he is but duſt; and ſhall anger make thee to forget that Promiſe? Hath not Mercie the higheſt ſeat in thine Arke; and ſhall anger be able to put her from her ſeate? Thou haſt beene my helper heretofore, and why didſt thou helpe me, but becauſe I needed thy aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? and may I not with thy aſſiſtance now returne from my evill way; if thou be pleaſed not to be ſo haſtie to turne me away? By thy helping me then, thou didſt expreſſe thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me then; and why then ſhould I feare, thou wilt now forſake mee? for whom thou loveſt, thou loveſt to the end; Not to the end, and then ends; but to the end, that ſhall never end. Shall the Heathen have cauſe, have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of cauſe, to upbraid thee with inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; that whom thou helpeſt at one time, thou forſakeſt at another? Or canſt thou turne mee away in anger; and then helpe mee in mercy, when thou haſt done? Canſt thou ſo ſoone change from Mercy to Anger; and from Anger againe to Mercie; that we ſhould never know in what temper to find thee? No my ſoule, farre be it from thee to have ſuch thoughts: but the truth is, Gods wayes are not diſcerned, not diſcernable by us, they are paſt our finding out: We know nothing at any time, what it is he doth; leſſe, why; and leaſt of all, how hee

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>12</label> ſubmit my ſelfe: but <hi>Deliver mee not over, to the will of my enemies:</hi> for thy will, when moſt ſevere, is yet with compaſſion; but their will, when moſt gentle, is alwayes with cruelty: And I ſpeake not this upon a bare ſuſpition; but I have evident proofes for what I ſay; For, <hi>falfe witneſſes are riſen up againſt mee; and ſuch as breath out crueltie.</hi> I deſired indeed to bee led in a plaine path; to the end I might walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, both before God and men; that ſo I might give my enemies no cauſe of offence; doe nothing whereof I might bee juſtly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but alas, what good hath my integritie done me? for ſo great is my enemies malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; that when they cannot charge mee truly, they accuſe me falſely: and becauſe they would not be ſeene in it themſelves, they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne witneſſes: and becauſe one witneſſe would not be ſufficient, Many; and leſt their witneſſes ſhould be apt to relent; they have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16288:32"/> gotten ſuch, as breath out crueltie; ſuch as make crueltie their living, and trade I may ſay, in no wares but cruell. Though I have a thouſand witneſſes of my innocencie; my owne conſcience; yet theſe witneſſes will not bee heard in the Courts of the world: Alas no, I know one, an innocent indeed, who had greater witneſſes then theſe, the witneſſes of his pious and wonderfull, and wonderfull pious workes; yet neither would theſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for witneſſes of his innocencie; but in the Courts of the world, hee was condemned as guiltie.</p>
            <p>O my ſoule, I had utterly fainted under this burden, if it had not beene for one thing; <hi>If I <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>13</label> had not beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord, in the land of the living.</hi> The onely hope of this, hath kept me from fainting: and how could it chooſe? being a Cordiall made up of three ſoveraigne Ingredients; a hope to ſee; and to ſee the goodneſs of God; and the goodneſs of God in the land of the living: three ſuch Ingredients, that he muſt be one of a very faint heart, whom ſuch a Cordiall will not keepe from fainting.</p>
            <p>But what ingredient of comfort, is a hope to ſee? for doe I not ſee now, as well as I am like to doe hereafter? were not our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents eyes opened in Paradiſe; and can wee hope to ſee better, then they ſaw there? and doe not our eyes ſtand as open as theirs ſtill? O my ſoule, the opening of their eyes then,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16288:33"/> hath made us ſee the worſe ever ſince: wee ſee now, but as in a Glaſſe, rather appearances of things, then things themſelves; we ſee nothing now but colours, and colours are deceitfull, and no truſting to them: the light I hope for, is to ſee, as I am ſeene; a ſight not ſubject to either dimneſſe, or dazeling: a ſight that diſcerneth not onely colours, but ſubſtances; and is not the hope of ſuch a ſight, a comfortable Ingredient to keepe from fainting?</p>
            <p>But yet what good is it, to ſee goodneſſe? for we ſee many good things, which yet wee are never the better for ſeeing: But is it not true here, <hi>Videte &amp; guſtate?</hi> for ſuch our ſeeing ſhall be: <hi>Vidchimus &amp; guſtavimus;</hi> our ſeeing ſhall be a taſting; our taſting, an enjoying; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying is not properly of any thing, but in which there is joy; and where there is joy, muſt there not needs be comfort?</p>
            <p>But yet what more goodneſſe of God can wee hope to ſee hereafter, then now? for can there bee a greater goodneſſe of God to bee ſeene then this, that hee makes the Sunne to ſhine, the raine to fall, upon both juſt and unjuſt? Wee ſee indeed now a great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: but wee ſee it mingled with much badneſſe of men; and may I not ſay with ſome badneſſe of his too? for is there any evill in the Citie, and God hath not done it? but the goodneſſe of God which I hope to ſee, is a goodneſſe like to garbled ſpice,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16288:33"/> without any mixture at all of refuſe ſtuffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it: a goodneſſe not mingled with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill of men, or evill to men; but pure and Impermixt as God himſelfe is. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God which we ſee now, is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in effects; but there is a goodneſſe in God, which is as the cauſe: Not as having goodneſſe, but as being goodneſſe: Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as imparting it ſelfe to us, but as communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it ſelfe with us; and this goodneſſe wee ſhall then ſee, though now we cannot. Have Philoſophers conceived, that if vertue could be ſeene with the eyes, <hi>Mirabiles excitaret amores ſui;</hi> It would ſtirre up in us a wonderfull love; and will not the goodneſſe of God, when ſeene with our eyes, ſtirre up in our hearts, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull joy? and is not the hope of ſuch a joy a ſtrong Cordiall to keepe from fainting?</p>
            <p>But why in the land of the living? for is not the world in which wee now live, the land of the living? Are there not, in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, living fiſhes? in the Ayre, living Birds? On the Earth, living Trees, living Beaſts, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men? and what can be thought of, more then theſe, to make a Land of the living? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what Land of the living is this, in which there are more dead then living; more under ground, then are above it: where the earth is fuller of graves then houſes; where life lyes trembling under the hand of Death, and where Death hath power to tyrannize over
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16288:34"/> life? No my ſoule, there onely is the Land of the living, where there are none but the living; where there is a Church not Militant, but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, a Church indeed, but no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, becauſe none dead, nor none that can dye: where life is not paſſive; nor Death active: where Life ſits crowned; and where Death is ſwallowed up in victorie. And now make up a Compound of theſe Ingredients: Take firſt, a Hope of ſeeing, which is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: then the goodneſſe of God, not a qualitie, but a ſubſtance: then the Land of the living, where there is no dying: and now ſay, if ſuch a Cordial muſt not needs be ſtrong, of neceſſitie be effectuall, to keepe from fainting? O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſoule, bee ſure to provide thee good ſtore of this Cordiall, that if at any time thou be oppreſſed, with either multitude, or malice; if at any time falſe witneſſes bee riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; if enemies at any time come upon thee, to eat up thy fleſh; thou maiſt have this Cordiall in a readineſſe, and be able to ſay; Doe the worſt you can, I feare you not; for I beleeve to ſee the goodneſſe of God in the Land of the living. This not onely will keepe thee from fainting, but wil fill thy ſpirits, with extaſie of joy: for it is grounded upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of comfort, delivered by Saint <hi>Paul; The afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be revealed:</hi> And what is this glory, but to ſee the goodneſſe of God? and where
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16288:34"/> to be revealed, but in the Land of the living?</p>
            <p>But all this yet, is but the hope of a Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; at moſt, but a Cordiall of hope: but when will the Cordiall it ſelfe, that is hoped for, bee had? May I not ſtay ſo long waiting for it, that I may be weary with waiting, and faint with wearineſſe? and then the Cordiall will come too late? No my ſoule, <hi>Waite on the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>14</label> Lord; be of good courage, and he ſhall give thee ſtrength:</hi> for as none is ſo worthy to be waited on, as God; ſo nothing is ſo worthy to be wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, as this Cordiall: and never feare wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe by long waiting for it, ſo long as thou waiteſt upon God for it: for, God that gives power to the Cordiall, to keepe thee from fainting, will give power to thy waiting, to keepe it from wearineſſe. Onely bee ſure to have a good heart, and God will not faile to ſupply it with ſpirits: Doe thou but onely bring wood to the Sacrifice, and God will ſend fire from Heaven to kindle it.</p>
            <p>But how happens it, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould give ſo good counſell to others, and yet follow it ſo ill himſelfe? for hee confeſſeth of himſelfe in another place; that <hi>hee is dejected, and bowed downe;</hi> and can it ſtand with courage, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? But is it not, that to be dejected, is a Paſſive infirmitie, to be couragious, an Active vertue; and there is no contradiction, to bee Paſſively weake, and Actively ſtrong, both at once. Or is it not indeed rather, that when he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16288:35"/> confeſſeth himſele to be dejected, hee lookes upon his ſinne; and ſinne will deject any, that hath but eyes, and is able to ſee it; but when he counſells to be couragious, hee lookes upon God; and God is ready to give ſtrength to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that hath but a heart, and is able to take it. As therefore I ſaid before, ſo I ſay againe; <hi>Waite on the Lord:</hi> which can never be too much taught, becauſe never enough be learned; never be too much ſaid, becauſe never be enough done.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>1</label> for Hoſanna's alwayes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Allelujahs; and therefore the Exordiums of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes are commonly thus; <hi>Have mercy upon mee, O God: heare my prayer, O Lord, rebuke mee not in thine anger:</hi> or ſome ſuch forme of Hoſanna: but in this Pſalme, contrary to his cuſtome, he makes his <hi>Exordium</hi> of an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah: <hi>I will extoll thee, O God:</hi> And why is this done? is it out of Devotion, that he might get before hand, and begin with God in Praiſes, before God ſhould begin with him in Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? O my ſoule, the ſhowres of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are ſo continually poured downe upon us, that it is impoſſible we ſhould ever get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with God in Allelujahs. Although
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16288:37"/> therefore he begin with an Allelujah, yet it is becauſe God hath prevented him in his Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: Hee will extoll God, but it is becauſe God hath lifted him up: Gods praiſe indeed is put in the Preſent Tenſe, but it is becauſe his benefit is in the Preterperfect Tenſe: <hi>I will extoll thee, O God; for thou haſt lifted mee up, and haſt not made my foes to rejoyce over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> will extoll God; how will he doe it? for to doe it unworthily, it were better to be left undone, and who is able to extoll God worthily? Hee will therefore perhaps call all the creatures of God to aſſiſt him, and ſay; <hi>Praiſe the Lord, all yee his Angels; Praiſe him all his Hoſts; praiſe yee him Sun and Moone; praiſe him all yee ſtarres of light: Let every thing that hath breath, praiſe the Lord.</hi> But if it be expected he muſt extoll him himſelfe; and not looke for helpe from others; Hee will then extoll him in his exaltation, and ſay; <hi>Bee thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:</hi> Or, he will extoll him in his owne humilitie, by kneeling, and falling downe before him: hee will extoll him in his ſingularitie, and ſay; There is no other God in heaven, or in earth, but onely, thou O God: or he will extoll him in his pluralitie, and ſay; Thou, O God, art wonderfull in thy Being; Three Perſons, and one God, bleſſed for ever. And if to extoll him with ſayings will not ſerve, he will then extoll him with workes, that men ſeeing his good workes, may glorifie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16288:37"/> our Father which is in heaven. And if neither words nor workes will be ſufficient; hoe will then extoll him with his ſilence, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: leaving that for Thought which cannot be expreſt: and leaving that for aſtoniſhment which cannot be conceived.</p>
            <p>But why is it that <hi>David</hi> will thus extoll God? Is it, that hee may returne a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe anſwerable to the benefit: returne it in the ſame kind, and anſwer it, as it were in its owne language? He will therefore extoll God, which is a kind of lifting God up: becauſe God hath lifted him up, which is a kind of extolling of him. For as our extolling of God, is the higheſt worke of our thankfulneſſe; ſo Gods lifting us up, is the greateſt benefit of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. We are thankfull to God, and ought to be, for his other benefits, even for caſting us downe: but we uſe not to extoll him, but for lifting us up: For naturally indeed, wee are all of us deſirous to bee lifted up; to be ſet aloft, and to be high in the world: for this pleaſeth the eyes, that they may ſee the more, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the whole body, that it may the more bee ſeene: but this is not the lifting up that <hi>David</hi> meanes; but to be lifted up out of danger; and out of the reach of the arme of his enemies. O my ſoule, let this bee thy comfort, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thy enemies be many, and great, yet they are not more thy enemies, then they are Gods ſlaves; and can goe no further, then the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16288:38"/> length of their chaine, which is ſeldome ſo long to reach to triumphing. Sathan was a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie to <hi>Job,</hi> and had certainly defeated him utterly, if God had not held him ſhort in his chaine; and though linke after linke, hee eetched out his chaine to a great length, yet he could never make it reach ſo farre, as to a Triumph. For it is not properly a Triumph, but when <hi>Dux Duci arma detrahit;</hi> When one Generall diſarmes another: and this could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done to <hi>Job;</hi> for he kept on his Armour ſtill; his Helmet of Faith; and his Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe, hee never let it goe off from him: that there could be no cauſe for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to triumph. Men commonly are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſſe themſelves can triumph over their enemies: but it is enough for me, O Lord, that thou ſuffer not my enemies to triumph over me: for I aime not at glory, but at ſafetie; I might then ayme at glory, if I were the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: but now that I am onely the aſſailed; what can I more deſire then ſafetie, and to bee out of the reach of all my enemies? and ſuch ſafetie, without any glory, may well give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, ſeeing of all the miſeries that can befall a man in this wretched world; there is none greater, none ſo great, as to fall into the hands of enemies, whoſe Malice, like the fire of Hell, is commonly unquenchable. Let a friend ſtrike me, and it ſhall be a Balme to my head; but to be ſtrucken by an enemie, who can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16288:38"/> it? The ſtriking of a friend is out of love, and intends amendment; but the blowes of an enemie are out of malice, and tend to ruine. It troubles mee not, that my enemies rejoyce, ſo their rejoycing have no relation to mee: It troubled not <hi>Samſon</hi> ſo much, to have his eyes put out, as to bee brought out before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be the laughing-ſtock for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at.</p>
            <p>But why will <hi>David</hi> ſpeake thus; <hi>Thou haſt not made my enemies to rejoyce over me:</hi> as though it were God, that made our enemies to rejoyce over us, and not their owne ſpitefulneſſe and malice? Is it, that permiſſion is in God a kind of action; and therefore he may juſtly be ſaid to doe that, which he ſuffers to be done? Or is it, that in his anger, he makes our enemies the Executioners of his juſtice: and puniſheth our neglect of rejoycing in him, with giving them power to rejoyce over us? and ſo their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, is not more in us, his judgement; then it is in them his act and operation.</p>
            <p>But what enemies do we talk of, all this while? worldly minds have no feare, but of worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and from ſuch, perhaps worldly friends may free them: but the ſpirituall man feares rather ſpiritual enemies; and who can free them from ſuch, but onely thou, O God, that art the God of ſpirits? O mercifull God, let not ſpirituall enemies have the victory over mee; and I make no great reckoning of other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16288:39"/> triumphing: Alas! I know that worldly enemies can never triumph over me, if ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies get not firſt the victory.</p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, if God have done this for me, have lifted me up above theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, above theſe enemies of both kindes, have I not a double cauſe to extoll him for it, and to praiſe his Name? And yet I may ſay, I extoll him not more for doing it, then for his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of doing it; <hi>For I cryed unto him, and hee healed mee:</hi> I no ſooner cryed, but hee heard me; he no ſooner heard me, but he healed me; My ſuite was no ſooner made, then granted; My diſeaſe as ſoone cured, as diſcovered; hee kept me not languiſhing, by drawing out his cure in length; but he applyed a preſent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and prevented Hope with haſt. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I extolled him before for his love, in lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me up above my enemies; ſo I muſt extoll him now for his compaſſion, in being moved to doe it, for my onely crying to him; I uſed no interceſſour, but my owne voyce, and hee healed me; and for God to be moved with the cry of a wretched ſinner; and ſo to be moved, as preſently to heale him; Is it not a juſt cauſe to extoll him, and ſay; O the wonderfull bowels of compaſſion that are in God?</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> To be lifted up from any place, is an act of Power; but the lower the place is, it is the greater act of Mercie; and can there be a lower place then the Grave? at leaſt, then the grave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16288:39"/> of the Soule? and from this low place, was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> lifted up, as yee may heare himſelfe ſay; <hi>Thou, O Lord haſt brought up my ſoule from the grave; Thou haſt kept mee alive, that I ſhould not goe downe into the pit.</hi> But is not this a ſtrange ſpeech in <hi>David,</hi> as though there were a grave of the Soule, as there is of the Body? for if there be not, how then is it true, that God hath brought up his ſoule from the Grave? Is it perhaps, that he calls it the Soule, which is but the cementing of the Body, and life together? or that he calls it the Grave of the Soule, when it is in the loweſt eſtate of vivifying the Body? What ever it be, it ſhewes a great mercy in God, and a great power of that mercy, to raiſe him up, that was brought ſo low, and to keepe him from falling into the Pit, that was fallen already to the pits brinke. The truth is, that as ſinne is the death of the Soule, ſo continuance in ſinne, is the grave of the Soule; and in this Grave of continuance, did <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule lye a long time: (Alas! the ſhorteſt time, in this caſe is long) till God by his quickning Spirit, reſtored him againe to the life of Grace; that hee had juſt cauſe to ſay; <hi>Thou, O Lord, haſt brought up my ſoule from the grave, and haſt kept mee alive, that I ſhould not goe downe into the Pit.</hi> Oh how many there are that have bodyes wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king above ground, when their ſoules are lying in the Grave? that are luſtie and ſtrong in the naturall life; when in the ſpirituall life, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16288:40"/> are dead and buryed? yet ſo long as they lye not buried above foure dayes, ſo long as they continue not in ſin ſo long, till it have brought the Soule into an abſolute corruption; there is example in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and where there is Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is hope, they may be raiſed againe to life, and be kept from falling into the Pit of perdition. And now, O my ſoule, though God have not lifted thee up to as high a place; yet ſeeing he hath lifted thee up from as low a place, as he did <hi>David:</hi> haſt thou not as juſt cauſe as he to ſay; <hi>I will extoll thee, O God; for thou haſt lifted mee up, and haſt not ſuffered my enemies, ſinne, and death, to triumph over mee.</hi> And here I find my ſelfe ſo oppreſſed with joy, that I am not able to expreſſe it without aſſiſtance; and what aſſiſtance can I looke for, but from the Saints of God? O therefore <hi>ſing unto the Lord, all yee ſaints of his; give thankes unto him at the remembrance of his Holineſſe.</hi> It is not enough to praiſe him, if yee doe not ſing his praiſes; for it muſt be done with cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and exultation; and it is not enough to ſing, if yee doe not praiſe him; for your joy muſt be in him, and for him: in his goodneſſe, and for his glory.</p>
            <p>If it were to ſing of another thing, I ſhould require the whole Quire of Gods creatures, to joyne in the ſinging; but now, that it is to ſing of Gods holineſſe; what ſhould prophane voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe in the Conſort? None but Saints are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16288:40"/> fit to ſing of holineſſe, and ſpecially of Gods holineſſe; but moſt ſpecially with ſongs of holineſſe. O therefore <hi>ſing to the Lord, all yee ſaints of his;</hi> and let your ſongs, be more of his praiſes, then of your owne thankfulneſſe: and let your thankfulneſſe, not be ſo much for the benefits which you have received; as for the holineſſe with which they are beſtowed: for God gives not his benefits, as the world uſeth to doe, out of any corrupt affection, or with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupt intention; but there is a holineſſe in his giving, as well as in his gifts; and ſeeing the Cherubins, and Seraphins doe continually cry to God; Holy, Holy, Holy: You that are his Saints may well afford to ſing to God, at the remembrance of his holineſſe.</p>
            <p>But what holineſſe can there be in Anger? <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> and is there not anger in God ſometimes? and will not this then bee a cauſe, rather of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to thinke of his anger; then of ſinging, at the remembrance of his holineſſe? O my ſoule, this need be no cauſe to breake off the ſinging; <hi>for his anger endureth but a moment;</hi> and even anger it ſelfe, is in God a holineſſe; It is none of the things that are naturall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in God; It is but forced upon him by the violence of ſinne; and as forced as it is, it ſtayes not with him; it is but as a wind that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; <hi>Dum oritur moritur;</hi> It dyes in the birth; Nothing lives, and is permanent in God, but onely his favour, and his love, and therefore,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16288:41"/> 
               <hi>Though weeping may endure for a night, yet joy commeth in the morning.</hi> And ſeeing our life is of this condition, that heavineſſe ſometimes muſt as well be had as joy; it is happy for us, they are ſo diſpoſed, that heavineſſe comes but in the Evening, when wee may ſleepe it out; and when our ſenſes are apt to be tyed up from feeling it: but joy commeth in the Morning; when all our ſenſes are waking to entertaine it. What is the Evening, but the end of the day? and what is the Evening of our life, but the end of our dayes? and in this Evening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is commonly heavineſſe; weeping for parting of friends that have lived together: but this heavineſſe is removed aſſoone as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes; for what is the Morning, but when the Sunne riſeth againe? and what is our Morning, but when we ſhall riſe againe? and as when this morning comes, there will bee a day that ſhall have no more Evening; ſo when this joy comes, all teares ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and there ſhall be no more weeping. Indeed all our great joyes have ever come in the morning: It was a Joy that came in the morning, at the Birth of Chriſt; It was a Joy that came in the morning, at the Reſurrection of Chriſt; It was a Joy that came in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at the Deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles; and theſe Joyes were then ſo great, that they have made us Feaſts ever ſince: <hi>(Our Chriſtmaſſe, our Eaſter, and our Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide:)</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:16288:41"/> yet theſe Joyes had their heavineſſe preceding: the Joy of Chriſts birth, had the heavineſſe of his Mothers ſlight; the Joy of Chriſts Reſurrection, had the heavineſſe for his Paſſion: the Joy of the Deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, the heavineſſe for Chriſts depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but theſe heavineſſes were ſo preſently followed with joyes, that it hath made this Aphoriſme be found true ſtill; <hi>Heavineſſe may endure for a night, but joy commeth in the morning.</hi> And now, O my ſoule, what need it trouble thee, to have heavineſſe in the Evening, ſo long as thou art ſure to have joy in the morning? What need it trouble thee to be weeping for a time, when thou art ſure of rejoycing, when time ſhall be no more?</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have beene buſie about ſinging Gods praiſes, for lifting mee up, which hath beene his worke; Now I muſt leave ſinging, and come to ſaying, to ſpeake of my owne worke; <hi>And I ſaid in my proſperitie, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> be moved:</hi> but alas, if my ſinging were no <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>7</label> better then my ſaying, it had beene better for me, to have held my peace in both: for what a ſaying is this, to ſay; <hi>I ſhall never be moved?</hi> Is there any Mountaine ſo ſtrong, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved? and if no Mountaine, how any man? but this is the inſolent language of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, to give over crying to God, and fall a boaſting of it ſelfe. Alas! Proſperitie hath neither good tongue, nor good eyes; as it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16288:42"/> made <hi>David</hi> ſay, hee ſhould never be moved; ſo it made him thinke it enough, that God by his favour had made his Mountaine ſtrong; but as for the maintaining it ſtrong, to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that to himſelfe: when God knowes, if once we leave depending upon God, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing to our ſelves, our Mountaine will ſoone bee turned into a Valley, and our ſtrength will goe from us, as it did from <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> when his haire was cut off; and this makes <hi>David</hi> ſay now; <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled:</hi> for as it is the favour of God, that makes our Mountaine ſtrong; and our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine being ſtrong, wee are kept from trouble: ſo it is the hiding of Gods face, that makes our moutaine weake; and our mountaine being weake, wee are preſently troubled; but rather indeed, if God doe not as well maintaine our mountaine ſtrong, as make it ſtrong, we ſhall quickly bring our Mountaine to a Mole-hill; wee ſhall quickly either fall our ſelves from our Mountaine; or have our mountaine to fall upon us.</p>
            <p>Wee ſee the Earth hath no comfort but in the Sunne; and therefore if the Sunne bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Earth preſently puts on Blacks; is pincht with cold, and covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: That which the Sunne is to the Earth; thy Face, O God, is to me, and what marvell then, when thou hideſt thy face; if I bee left, as a diſconſolate Earth, in trouble and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16288:42"/> God uſeth not to hide his face from any that depend upon him; and therefore as long as I put my truſt and confidence in him, he was to me as a ſtrong Mountain; I enjoyed his favour, and the light of his Countenance; but aſſoone as I left depending upon him, and truſted to my owne ſtrength, my Mountaine was ſuddenly turned into a Valley; and I was left alas in a vale of miſerie. O therefore, my ſoule, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any proſperitie whatſoever; Doe thou depend upon God for thy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, both for making it ſtrong, and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing it ſtrong, and never bee moved to ſay, thou ſhalt never be moved; for to bee immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, is a priviledge of God himſelfe, and of God alone, and is not communicable to any creature. It is a falſe ſaying in any eſtate to ſay; <hi>I ſhall never be moved;</hi> but in proſperitie, falſeſt of all: for hee that is in proſperitie, ſtands in a ſlipperie place, and ſuch a place is not capable of ſtabilitie. What is proſperitie but an earthy thing? and can any thing that is earthy be ſecure from moving, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earth it ſelfe is moved? O my ſoule, the conſideration of this; Alas! the feeling of this hath made mee leave, both ſinging, and ſaying, and fall to my crying againe: <hi>I cryed to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>8</label> Indeed crying is the voyce of a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and the fitteſt voyce for a ſupplication: but yet why ſhould <hi>David</hi> tell God of his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16288:43"/> crying to him, and ſay; <hi>I cryed to thee, O Lord;</hi> as though God knew it not, without his tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it? No doubt, God knew of his crying, for how elſe did he heare it? and of his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for how elſe could hee grant it? and therefore it ſeemes, hee tells it not ſo much to God, as to us; that wee may take notice, with what ſacrifices God is pleaſed. For as there are divers ſacrifices that are acceptable to God: ſo each of them, in the due time, is the fitteſt, and moſt acceptable: ſinging, fitteſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a benefit obtained; and crying, fitteſt for obtaining a benefit: Allelujahs fitteſt, when wee are in triumph: Hoſanna's, fitteſt when we are in diſtreſſe. And therefore being at the preſent, in perill of his life; and delivered as it were into the hands of Death; the ſacrifice he offers now, is a ſupplication; which yet ſeemes not ſo much a ſupplication, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation; <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Heare, O Lord; and have mercy upon me, Lord, bee thou my helper:</hi> for if thou lend mee not thine eare, how can I hope thou wilt ſhew mee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? and if thou have not mercy upon me, how can I hope thou wilt bee my helper? Heare me, O God, while I am in a place, where I may be heard; for if once I be deſcended into the Pit, I ſhall quite then be out of all hearing. Have mercy upon me, while I am capable of mercy; for if once I be turned into duſt, what mercy can I looke for? Be thou my helper, O God, now that I am in a ſtate to bee helped; for if my bloud in which my life conſiſts bee once ſhed; what good then will thy helpe doe me? I place Gods mercy in the midſt here, becauſe it muſt ſerve to both the other; both to make God to heare me, and to make him to helpe me: and Gods mercy can doe both; it can make him to heare me, though I were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and can make him to helpe me, though I were duſt. But though Gods mercy can doe it, am I ſure it will doe it? O my ſoule, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath done it already: for it is the worke of his mercy, that <hi>Hee hath turned my mourning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dauncing, that hee hath put off my ſackcloth, and girded mee with gladneſſe.</hi> O wonderfull converſion; the very ſame myracle, I may ſay, that Chriſt wrought at the Mariage in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16288:44"/> 
               <hi>Cana,</hi> for to turne Mourning into Dauncing; what is it, but to turne water into Wine? To have turned my mourning, but into comfort, had beene a great worke, and a great favour: but to turne my mourning into dauncing; the extremitie of ſorrow, into extremitie of joy; who could doe this, but thou onely, O God; with whom, as no Myracles are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſo no extremities are limits. Mourning is not properly, but for one that is dead: and indeed ſo neere being dead was I, that I might well be ſaid to mourne for my owne death: not unlike the Swan; if it be true, that ſhee ſings her owne Elegie: and now to have my mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning turned into dauncing; the drooping act for Death, be turned into the moſt lively act of Life: what is it, but the Myracle, as it were, of Reſurrection, and Aſcention both at once? at leaſt, from the loweſt ſtayre of miſerie, to be raiſed to the higheſt of happineſſe: and not <hi>Gradatim,</hi> by degrees and ſteps, but <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> by a motion more ſwift, than the Fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, that carried up <hi>Elias</hi> into Heaven: and ſo the change not more wonderfull, then the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe; Mourning turned into Dauncing, a wonderfull change; and done, as it were, in the turning of a hand, as wonderfull a ſuddenneſſe.</p>
            <p>And now to make me fit for Dauncing; <hi>Thou haſt put off my ſackcloth, and girded me with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> for indeed, if I had kept on my ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth ſtill; I ſhould have made but a heavie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16288:45"/> Dauncer; but now, that my ſackcloth is off, and I am girded with gladneſſe; I ſhall leape as light, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to ſee thy day.</p>
            <p>I put on ſackcloth when I was a Mourner; but now that I am to be a Dauncer, I am girded with gladneſs: and if I mourned before, to think of Gods anger; may I not juſtly daunce now, to thinke of his favour? If I put on ſackcloth before, as ſorrowing for my ſinne; may I not juſtly now be girded with gladneſſe, as rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in my Saviour? For though it be Gods mercy, that hath done this for me, yet it is his mercy in Chriſt my Saviour: without whom, his mercy alone would never have done it: He would never have put off my ſackcloth, and girded me with gladneſſe, but for his ſake, and through his meanes, that was anoynted with the Oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes. My ſackcloth was but a looſe garment about mee, which might eaſily be put off at pleaſure, but my gladneſſe is girt about me, to bee faſt and ſure, and cannot leave me, though it would; at leaſt, none ſhall be able to take it from me.</p>
            <p>And now, though this be ſpoken here in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> yet it may bee conceived as in Type for all the godly: if they mourne, and lye in ſackcloth now; yet they ſhall ere long be girded with Gladneſſe, and daunce for joy; but what Dauncing? Not like that of <hi>Herodias</hi> Daughter; for which <hi>Herod</hi> allowed her to aske halfe his Kingdome; but like that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:16288:45"/> before the Arke; for which God without asking, will give us a whole Kingdome. And when ſhall the time bee? Alas! it cannot be long: For they ſhall not goe out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the old Iſraelites did, by the tedious paſſages of a troubleſome Wilderneſſe; but their Mourning ſhall be turned into Dauncing: a converſion as ſudden, as when <hi>Moſes</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous hand was turned to be ſound againe, by putting it onely in his boſome.</p>
            <p>But to what end is it, that God hath done <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>12</label> this for me? It may be thought, becauſe hee hath turned my Mourning into Dauncing, and hath girded me with Gladneſſe; that hee hath done it to this end, that I might live in jollity, and ſpend my time with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> in revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and feaſting: but there is no ſuch matter: hee hath done it to this end, <hi>that my glory may ſing praiſe unto him, and not bee ſilent:</hi> to this end, that not onely I may praiſe him, but may ſing his praiſes; and not onely that I, but that my glory may ſing them; and alas what glory have I? doth not all glory belong to God? Indeed ſo it is, my glory then ſings his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when I aſcribe to him all praiſe and glory; my glory then ſings his prayſes, when I praiſe him with all I have to glory in, with all the faculties and powers of my ſoule and body; thoſe eſpecially in which I was made after his Image, for this is my Glory.</p>
            <p>If this then bee the end that God intends,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16288:46"/> ſhall I be ſo ungratefull, to croſſe his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? if hee have given mee a Tongue, and a Voyce to ſerve him; ſhall I hold my peace, and be ſilent in his ſervice? if he have turned my Mourning into Dauncing; ſhall I bee ſullen, and ſlow to ſing his Prayſes? Alas! my Daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing can never be kindly without Muſick; and what muſick ſo fit for it, as ſinging? and what ſinging ſo fit, as to the Ditty of his Prayſes? O my ſoule, ſeeing God hath procured thee libertie to Daunce, thou mayſt well afford to find the muſick: and yet neither my Dauncing ſhall hearken to the muſicke, nor my ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall looke toward the Dauncing; but my Singing and my Dauncing both, ſhall bee addreſſed, and directed to God alone. Shall my heart be ſo ſet upon my joy, as to make me forget the Authour of my joy? No, O God, my joy hath ſo ſure a foundation, that I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be unmindfull of the Founder: <hi>I will give thankes to thee, O Lord, my God, for ever.</hi> Not for a time which will ceaſe; Not as long as the Sunne and Moone endure, which ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes endure; not as long as I have breath in my body; No my ſoule, but as long as thou thy ſelfe haſt Being; which being breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee by God, ſhall never ceaſe; ſhall alwayes endure; ſhall be forever.</p>
            <p>When I extolled God, I had relation to his Omnipotencie: when I ſung his Prayſes, to his Mercie; and now that I give him thankes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16288:46"/> for ever, to his Eternitie: that now I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and ſay; O Almightie, moſt Mercifull, and ever-living God; to thee be aſcribed all Honour, Prayſe, and Glory, world without end.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Las! what a Vow is this that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>1</label> 
               <hi>David</hi> makes here? a Vow which hee is ſure before hand, he cannot keepe: for is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to bleſſe God at all times? Is there not a time of paine and miſerie, in which <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to curſe God and dye? and can curſing of God, ſtand with bleſſing of God? O my ſoule, I take not my meaſure of bleſſing God from the laſt of that wicked Woman; it is not paine; it is not miſerie; it is not extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of paine, or miſerie, that ſhall make mee to breake my Vow in bleſſing of God: but if it be thought ſo great a matter to bleſſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſery; I will ſtretch my Vow yet further, for I will bleſſe him for miſerie: and I may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16288:50"/> truly ſay, if it were not for paine, and miſery; I ſhould want one ſpeciall Motive for bleſſing of God.</p>
            <p>But yet there is a time of ſleepe, which is a tribute due to Nature; and is it poſſible to pay the tribute of ſleepe to Nature, and the tribute of bleſſing to God, both at once? If then ſleepe be of neceſſitie ſo oftentimes, how can bleſſing of God be performed at all times? O my ſoule, when our waking is terminated with bleſſing of God; that bleſſing is in force till we wake againe: for as in what place the tree falleth, there it lyeth: ſo in what ſtate the Soule goes to reſt, in that ſtate it reſteth: If my ſoule ſay to God; I will lay mee downe to ſleepe, for it is Thou, Lord, onely that ſuſtaineſt me; my ſoule ſhall have it returned from God; Thus the Lord giveth his beloved ſleepe.</p>
            <p>But if thus perhaps be made good the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Bleſſing God: yet in what conſiſts the worke of bleſſing him? Is it onely in Thought, or onely in a good intention? No my ſoule; <hi>his praiſe ſhall continually bee in my mouth:</hi> for though the heart indeed bee the Fountaine of bleſſing him: yet out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh; and therefore it ſhall not be cloyſtered up in the Cells of ſilence, but it ſhall have vent, and bee brought into the light; that if it bee not ſaid, that men ſeeing my good workes, it may at leaſt be ſaid, that men hearing my good words,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16288:50"/> may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. But doe I not by this, fall againe upon my old difficultie? for if it ſeemed impoſſible before to bleſſe God at all times, may it not juſtly ſeeme as impoſſible now, that his Praiſe ſhould continually be in my mouth? It may perhaps be true of the Angels, in whoſe mouthes wee know of nothing there is continually, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath: but to be verefied of the mouthes of men, ſeemes a thing impoſſible; for is there not a neceſſitie of ſpeaking many things, beſides Gods praiſes? yet nothing muſt bee ſpoken, but either his Praiſe, or to his praiſe, or elſe wee breake our Vow. And how then is this Riddle to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? Is it not as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it: <hi>Whither yee eat, or drinke, or whatſoever yee doe elſe; let all be done to the praiſe, and glory of God.</hi> And if all wee doe, may bee done to the praiſe of God, then certainly all we ſpeake, may bee ſpoken to the praiſe of God: and indeed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he never ceaſeth to ſend forth continually his bleſſings; with what reaſon can we ceaſe to ſet forth continually his Praiſes?</p>
            <p>But when I make this Vow to bleſſe God at all times; I make it not preſuming upon any abilitie in my ſelfe: Alas! I know my owne weakneſſe, and how unready I am to any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <hi>but my ſoule maketh her boaſt in the Lord:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>2</label> My confidence is, that he who hath given mee the reſolution to will it, will give mee alſo the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16288:51"/> power to performe it; that Hee who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the worke, will alſo finiſh it; and being ſo good an Architect, as he is, will not lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but will as well alſo ſet on the Roofe. If I ſhould boaſt in my ſelfe, I ſhould doe wrong to God: but if I boaſt not in God, I doe wrong to my ſelfe: ſeeing God is a ſtrength to none, but to them that make him their ſtrength; and none make him their ſtrength, but they that make their boaſt of him. It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring Boaſting, and Humilitie, to meet together in one ſubject, betweene which there is ſo naturall an Antipathie: yet here it is done: for this I may ſay is the humble boaſting; where a vaine man may glory without vaine-glory, where a weake Agent may preſume without preſumption: Not like the boaſting of the Phariſee, ſo hatefull in the eyes of God, ſo offenſive in the eares of the humble: For the <hi>Humble can heare this boaſting, and bee glad,</hi> which they would never doe; if it were not conformable to the rules of Humility. Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boaſting be greater then to ſay; <hi>I can doe all things?</hi> yet in this boaſting, there is humilitie, when I adde; <hi>In him that comforteth mee.</hi> For though God like not of boaſting; yet he likes of this boaſting, which arrogates nothing to our ſelves, but aſcribes all to him: and ſeeing my ſoule boaſteth her felfe of God, I doubt not, but as the humble heare it, and bee glad; ſo God ſees it, and is pleaſed, and accepts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16288:51"/> my Boaſting as a ſacrifice of Humilitie.</p>
            <p>But to what end is it that my Boaſting tends? Is it to ſet forth my owne worthineſſe, and to vaunt of my abilities? Is it to tread in the ſteps of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or to walke in the way of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee? God forbid, the humble then would not be glad to heare my boaſting: No my ſoule, it is to magnifie the Lord; <hi>O therefore <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> magnifie the Lord with mee; and let us exalt his Name together:</hi> for alas what am I to magnifie his Name my ſelfe alone, if I have not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to helpe me? All I can doe, and all the humble can doe, is but to ſay; Not unto us, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, but to thy Name give the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which is rather a vilifying of our ſelves, then a magnifying of him: they muſt be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a better mettall that can ſerve, and yet cannot ſerve to magnifie him as they ſhould: and it is not the worke of a few: all the Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of millions, in Heaven, and Earth, have enough to doe, and more then enough, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his Name: O therefore, yee Bleſſed Spirits of heaven; doe you magnifie the Lord, but take mee with you in your company, that though I adde nothing to the weight of the worke; yet I may adde one to the number of the worke-men in magnifying his Name. We that are dwellers on the Earth, can exalt his Name no higher then the Heavens, and there you that be Inhabitants of Heaven muſt take it, and exalt it higher; and ſo betweene us all,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16288:52"/> wee ſhall make a ſhift to exalt him to his true Elevation, for his Glory is above the Heavens. But if perhaps you thinke ſcorne of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as being men of polluted lips, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not worthy to bee of your Conſort; yet the humble will make a conſort by themſelves, and will not, indeed cannot be kept from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting his Name: for our Humilitie, is his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation; and then wee raiſe him up to the height of his Throne, when we caſt our ſelves downe, as low as his Footſtoole: that it is but a diverſe expreſſing of the ſame thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whither we ſay; Let us exalt the Name of the Lord; Or let us fall downe, and kneele, before the Lord our Maker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> is not wont to uſe Exclamations, but upon ſpeciall occaſion: if he uſe one here, and ſay; O magnifie the Lord; we may know that to magnifie his Name, is a thing of great importance: indeed ſo great, that all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it, at leaſt all things without it, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanitie. O then all you that be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Heaven, and all you that bee humble in the earth; and leſt any be left out where all are too few; O all ye workes of the Lord; bleſſe yee the Lord; Praiſe him, and magnifie him <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> forever. <hi>For I ſought the Lord, and he heard me; and delivered mee from all my feares:</hi> To ſeeke, and upon ſeeking to be heard, is a great favour: but to bee heard, and upon hearing to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all feares, is a favour that deſerves
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16288:52"/> Magnifying in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>But why is it that I ſought him? is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had loſt him before? and why ſhould I ſeeke to get him againe, and would not keepe him, when I had him? O my ſoule, <hi>Carendo magis quam fruendo;</hi> Wee know the goodneſſe of things, more by wanting them, then by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them, though I could not ſee what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe it was to have him; yet I ſee what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie it is to want him: and yet in this I account my ſelfe happy, that I have ſought him while he was within hearing: for alas, if I had ſtayed from ſeeking him, till hee had beene out of hearing; What hope could I have had; of ever recovering him?</p>
            <p>But O the tender mercies of God, that hath not ſuffered me to put off, my ſeeking him ſo long: for, O my ſoule, it is no leſſe his mercie that I ſeeke him, then that hee heares me; my deſire is not more to have him, then his to bee had; for how elſe could he have heard mee as ſoone as I ſought him, but that hee ſtood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening, as it were, when I would ſeeke him? and he heard me not as one that were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whither he head me or no; but he gave me audience with no leſſe Intention to grant my ſuit, then attention to know it; for heare the ſucceſſe of my ſeeking him; ſee the fruit of his hearing me; <hi>He delivered mee from all my feares;</hi> To have delivered mee from all my troubles, had beene a great favour; but a farre greater, to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16288:53"/> deliver me from all my feares; for where that, would have but freed me from preſent evill; This ſecures me from evill to come; that now I enjoy not onely Tranquilitie, but ſecuritie: a priviledge onely of the godly: The wicked may be free from trouble, but can they be free from feare? No, God knowes, though they be not in trouble like other men, yet they live in more feare then other men; Guiltineſſe of mind, or mind of the world never ſuffers them to be ſecure; though they bee free ſometimes from the fit of an Ague, yet they are never without a grudging: and (if I may uſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Poets) though they feele not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Whippe of <hi>Tyſiphone,</hi> yet they feele alwayes her terrours; and ſeeing the Lord hath done this for me, hath delivered me from all my feares; have I not cauſe, juſt cauſe to magnifie him, and exalt his Name?</p>
            <p>But is Gods mercy confined onely to mee, and not extended as well to others? Yes, my ſoule, <hi>Deus omnibus idem;</hi> God is good to all: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> his mercy is over all his workes; Not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, as being above them all; but over them as extended to them all: for other as well as I, <hi>Looked unto him, and were lightened.</hi> But ſhould it not bee rather ſaid; God looked to them, and they were lightened, then to ſay; They looked to God, and were lightened? For God is Light, and when the Light lookes to us, we are ſure to be lightened: but wee that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16288:53"/> are darkneſſe may looke to the Light, and yet continue in darkneſſe ſtill? but is it not, that the influence of Gods favour deſcends upon the godly in a kind of correſpondence to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: if they cry, they ſhall be heard: if they mourne, they ſhall be comforted; if they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, they ſhall be exalted; ſo here, becauſe they looked to God, they were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. Indeed Light is the proper inheritance of the godly, as being the children of light; which though they cannot deſerve, yet they may expect; and have they not reaſon then to looke to him, in whom it is, and from whom it muſt come? They little deſerve to be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that will not looke to him that is their light: If it may be had for a looke, and they will not doe that; they worthily deſerve to be kept in darkneſſe. It is true, all would be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but all take not the right courſe; they looke not the right way: There are ſome that looke to the ſtarres to bee lightened, becauſe the ſtarres indeed are glorious bodyes, and give light to the world; and theſe are ſuch as attribute all to Chance, and Fortune: and there are ſome, and theſe the worſt ſome, that looke to <hi>Lucifer</hi> to be lightened, becauſe they thinke he beares not his name for nought; and theſe are ſuch as light them Candles of impietie, and by impietie: but theſe are deluſions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures: the way to bee truly lightened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is to looke to God: for hee is the Father
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16288:54"/> of Lights: and as there is nothing with him; ſo there comes nothing from him, but onely Light. O then, my ſoule, looke to God, and he will lighten thee; looke to him with the eye of Faith, and the light of his Countenance ſhall ſhine upon thee.</p>
            <p>But though the children of the world bee wiſer in their Generation, then the children of Light; yet in this, the godly are the wiſer: <hi>for they looked to God, and were lightened: and their faces were not aſhamed:</hi> But may wee not ſay then, the more ſhame for them? for is it not true which is ſaid, that nothing belongs to us, but confuſion, and ſhame of face? may we not be aſhamed to ſhew our faces to God, being ſo foule, and filthy as they are, ſeeing hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures nothing that is uncleane? O my ſoule, as they that looked to the Brazen Serpent were preſently healed; ſo they that looke to God, are preſently lightened: for though looking to the materiall Sunne, bee a cauſe to ſtayne, and tanne the face: yet looking to the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe is a meanes to cleanſe it, and make it amiable: and why then ſhould they be aſhamed? Is it any ſhame to ſhew our ſores to our Phyſitian? or any ſhame to ſhew our faults to our Confeſſour? No more is it any ſhame to ſhew our faces to God, though never ſo foule, and ſo full of ſtaynes, ſeeing hee is the true Phyſitian that onely can cure us; Hee the true Confeſſour that onely can abſolve us.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:16288:54"/>
            <p>But who are they that were lightened? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Pauci quos aequus amavit:</hi> ſome few that were in his favour; perhaps rich men that could offer him Hecatombes, and plentifull ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: No my ſoule; <hi>The poore man cryed, and hee heard him: and ſaved him out of all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> for God is no accepter of perſons; Hee neither regards the legges of the ſtrong, nor the faces of the beautifull, nor the wealth of the rich; but whoſoever they be that looke to him, and feare him, they are ſure to taſte of his mercy and goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>But though the poore man cryed, are wee ſure he cryed to God? hee might cry out of ſenſe of his miſery; and what were this to move God to heare? O my ſoule, any crying of the godly, is a Muſick with which God is pleaſed, or at leaſt is moved: if it bee a crying out of ſenſe of miſerie, God is moved with it in his mercy, if a crying out of Devotion; God is pleaſed with it in his Juſtice. O then my ſoule, rather never cry, then not cry to God: for by crying to him, thou getteſt, I may ſay, two ſtrings to thy bow: both his Mercie, and his Juſtice: and were it not folly to leave out one, where thou mayſt have both? But though wee know not what the poore mans crying was, yet wee ſee what Gods hearing was: for hearing him, hee ſaved him from all his troubles: and who would not cry, to be ſo heard? The world may thinke it a ſtrange
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16288:55"/> courſe in the poore man, to cry to God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from his troubles, being ſo farre off from him: but how farre was hee from him, when he heard him? If hee were ſo neere to him, that he might heare him, hee could not be ſo farre from him, but he might helpe him. O my ſoule, let the world thinke their pleaſure; let them ſtudie, and plot, and caſt about how to bring their purpoſes to paſſe; Doe thou cry to God to deliver thee from thy troubles; for if thou cry, thou mayſt be ſure hee will heare thee; and if he heare, thou needſt not doubt but he will helpe thee. But yet miſtake not the meaning, when it is ſayd, that God ſaved him from all his troubles; as though, becauſe hee was a poore man, that therefore hee was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made rich: Or if he were in paine, that he had preſently eaſe: for God goes not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ordinary way of Phyſicians, to cure cold Diſeaſes with hot Medicines; his wayes of deliverance are often-times ſpirituall; and ſo <hi>Job</hi> might be ſaid to bee delivered from all his troubles, when God gave him patience to endure his troubles; but ſpecially <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſaid to bee delivered from his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when he was carryed by Angels into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> boſome.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>7</label> And here it falls out fitly to mention An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; <hi>for the Angell of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them.</hi> Wee little thinke we have a continuall guard
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16288:55"/> about us, and leſſe we thinke that wee have a whole Campe for our guard; but leaſt of all, that it is a Campe of Angels: oh how ſafe ſhould we thinke our ſelves, if this were ſo! O my ſoule, this is ſo, and yet wee thinke our ſelves not ſafe enough: and may it not then be juſtly ſaid; <hi>What doubt yee of, O yee of jittle faith?</hi> But how can wee thinke there be Angells to guard us; when we ſcarce thinke there be any Angels? for if there bee, they muſt bee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God: and then certainly creatures of a moſt excellent nature: and would <hi>Moſes</hi> then have left them out, in his Catalogue of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he reckons them all up? Indeed for this very reaſon, becauſe they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a moſt excellent Nature, hath <hi>Moſes</hi> left them out: for hee ſpeakes but of materiall Creatures, in this materiall world; of which number, the Angels are none. But wee may thinke perhaps there are none, becauſe wee can ſee none: as though we could ſee a thing that is inviſible? ſhall we therefore thinke we have no ſoules, becauſe we cannot ſee our ſoules? Wee live now by Faith, and not by ſight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can neither ſee ſoules nor Angels; we ſhall then ſee both, when we ſhall live by ſight, and not by Faith. Alas! if we beleeve no more then we ſee, we ſeeme not to live by Faith neither, for Faith beleeves that which it cannot ſee: Oh therefore my ſoule, to make it appeare thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and that thou liveſt by Faith; let this be an
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16288:56"/> Article of thy Creed, that the Angels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe and pitch their Tents about thee: that if at any time thou bee aſſaulted, if aſſaulted by enemies, if by an Army of enemies, thou maiſt have recourſe to the confidence of this Guard, and never tremble for any Alarum: ſeeing there are more with us, then are againſt us.</p>
            <p>But how can the godly thinke they have a Guard about them, when it is for Princes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have a Guard; and the godly for the moſt part are but private men? O my ſoule, this is a Guard that attends no leſſe the pooreſt man, then the greateſt Prince, and attends him with as much carefulneſſe, as if he were a Prince.</p>
            <p>But if there be Angels to defend the godly, why doe they not defend them? why doe they ſuffer them to be ſo moleſted, ſo afflicted as they are? for who are in ſuch troubles, who groane under ſuch afflictions as the godly? and would this be ſo, if that were ſo? would they be ſo oppreſſed, if they had Angels to relieve them? O my ſoule, thou little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt the infinite benefits that the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive by the miniſterie of Angels. If perhaps they ſuffer troubles of the body, doe they not eſcape farre greater of the ſoule? If they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure perhaps ſome momentarie afflictions, doe they not avoid afflictions that would be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting? Is there not an Army of malignant ſpirits to aſſault them, and could they be ſafe from tearing in peeces; if there were not a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16288:56"/> campe of Angels to aſſiſt them? But though the Angels be a guard to the whole man, both body and ſoule; yet being creatures ſpirituall and inviſible; they are chiefly a guard to the inviſible and ſpirituall part, which is the ſoule. The body they know muſt goe to the earth, and therefore though a part, is the leaſt part of their care: It is the Soule they chiefly waite upon, becauſe it is the ſoule they chiefly waite for: for they ſtand waiting for the ſoule, when it ſhall leave the body, that they may take it, and carry it into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome: for till then they breake not up their Campe.</p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, ſeeing the Angels are ſo beneficiall, and ſo good unto us; <hi>Oh taſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>8</label> and ſee how good the Lord is:</hi> for by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we find in the Angels, we may take a taſte of the goodneſſe that is in God: if it be a great goodneſſe in the Angels to encampe about us: how great is his goodneſſe that gives it them in charge? for the Angels would not doe it, if God did not command them: Alas! they could not doe it, if God did not enable them. <hi>Oh then, taſte and ſee, how good the Lord is;</hi> Not how good the Angels are, though they bee good, and exceeding good in their kind, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: yet what is this to the goodneſſe of God, who is the Fountaine of goodneſſe to the Angels themſelves?</p>
            <p>O then, <hi>Taſte, and ſee how good the Lord is:</hi> for taſte him we may, but we can but taſt him
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16288:57"/> while we live here, wee ſhall not have a full comprehenſion of him, till wee come to ſee, as we are ſeene, when wee ſhall need no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping of Angels round about us.</p>
            <p>O then, <hi>Taſt and ſee how good the Lord is;</hi> but how can wee taſt him that is not bodily? how ſee him that is not viſible? Not him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but his goodneſſe: and not his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither in its ſelfe, but in its effects; and not in its effects neither, as they ſhall be, but as they are, which God knowes, is but a ſmall part of that they ſhall be.</p>
            <p>O then, <hi>Taſte, and ſee how good the Lord is:</hi> if you would but taſte him, you would never take pleaſure in other meat: if you would but ſee him, you would never delight in other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: O my ſoule, if thou couldſt but taſte the ſweetneſſe; if but ſee the goodneſſe that is in God, it would make thee fall into a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, than that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at the ſight of Chriſts glory in the Mount: at leaſt it would weane thee from all the pleaſures, that the taſte, or the ſight, can miniſter to thee in this vaine world; for alas, what are the pleaſures of the taſte, to the ſweetneſſe that is in God, but as bitter Aloes, to the ſweeteſt honey? What are the delights that paſſe by the ſenſes, to the delight in God, that paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? May I not juſtly ſay now: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in him:</hi> for hee that truſteth in God, and he onely, is like to bee admitted to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16288:57"/> taſte the ſweetneſſe, and to ſee the goodnaſſe that is in God: which onely are the things that can make us bleſſed. What is it to truſt in God, but to depend wholly upon him, and to put all our confidence in him? To truſt in the world, is to leane upon a broken reede; to truſt in our ſelves, is to leane upon a ſhadow; onely to truſt in God, is the true <hi>Terra firma,</hi> where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels pitch their Tents; and where if wee fixe our ſelves, the gates of Hell can never prevaile againſt us. What preſerved <hi>Jonas</hi> in the Whales belly? What, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons denne; but only their truſt in God? O then my ſoule, doe thou alſo truſt in God, and hee will be the ſame God to thee, the ſame ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in thy dangers, as he was to <hi>Jonas</hi> and to <hi>Daniel.</hi> But yet let thy truſting in him be ſuch as that thou preſume not: for there are certaine bounds that muſt not be paſſed: It is as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to goe too farre in truſting in him, as to be too ſhort: and as it is Faith, that puts us on for comming too ſhort, ſo it is Feare that keepes us off from going too farre: O therefore <hi>Feare the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>10</label> Lord yee his ſaints; for there is no want to them that feare him.</hi> Verely a ſtrong Motive to make us feare God; ſeeing hee that feares him ſhall want nothing. And yet the Motive not ſo ſtrong, but the reaſon as apparant, for the Feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and Wiſedome I may ſay is the godly mans Purviour: and what marvell then if hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16288:58"/> want nothing that hath ſo cunning a Purveiour as Wiſedome, to keepe him from want: but then it muſt be from want of things that are good: for to want other things, is no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Wiſedomes pourveyance. O that men would underſtand how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things that are truly good indeed, and things that but onely ſeeme good! we ſhould then have a better world then wee have, and men would never complaine of want, when they have but too much: never bee ſo earneſt for ſupply of things, that truly conſidered, are but meerely ſuperfluous. If therefore one that feares God be in any want, we may know that the thing he wants is not good: for if it were good, he ſhould not want it: it may perhaps be good in it ſelfe, but not good for him, and if not good for him, hee cannot be truly ſaid to want it, becauſe indeed he were better be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>But is Feare a thing of ſuch force to ſupply our wants? One would rather thinke that boldneſſe and courage ſhould ſupply them? No my ſoule, for what creature ſo couragious <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> as the Lyon? <hi>Yet the young lyons doe lacke, and ſuffer hunger:</hi> whether they be young Lyons as depending upon the proviſion of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; or young in the ſtrength of their youth, that can provide for themſelves; yet they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lacke and ſuffer hunger: for indeed ſtrength of body, is not the beſt Purveiour: No
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16288:58"/> my ſoule, nothing but wiſedome makes the true purveyance, and no wiſedome without the feare of the Lord; and therefore none but they that feare the Lord can bee free from want.</p>
            <p>But is not this a fearefull doctrine, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee muſt feare, or elſe wee muſt want? were it not as good to want, as to have our wants ſupplyed by feare? Is not the Remedie worſe then the Diſeaſe? Alas! this is but the objection of Children; either Children in yeares, or Children in underſtanding, who know not what Feare it is I meane: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Come yee children, and hearken to mee: I will <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> teach you the feare of the Lord:</hi> It is not a Feare, that you need be afraid of; it is a feare, that will free you from all other feares; it is a feare that is Active; where all other feares are Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: It is a Feare that workes in love, and who would not love ſuch a Feare? It is a Feare that is joyned with Joy: a Feare, not to offend: but a Joy, for not offending: It is a Feare, not ſo much of Gods juſtice, as of his Mercy: for there is mercy with him that hee may bee feared: It is not a Feare that will ſhorten your life, but be a meanes to prolong it: but then it muſt not be a bare ſpeculative feare, but you muſt put it in practiſe: and theſe may bee the rules: <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill, and thy lippes <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>12</label> from ſpeaking guile: Depart from evill, and do good: ſeeke peace, and purſue it.</hi> Long life was once
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16288:59"/> promiſed before, to them that honour their Parents; and here it is promiſed againe to them that love their Neighbours; for theſe Rules are as the whole body of morall Philoſophie, and are therefore delivered in ſixe parts, like the ſix Commandements of the ſecond Table; which onely concerne our dutie to Neighbours: and in all of them the qualitie of chiefe Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and which keepes then all in tune, is Feare; <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill,</hi> for feare of the evill that may enſue: <hi>and thy lips from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king guile,</hi> for feare leſt thy guile bee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thy ſhame. <hi>Depart from evill;</hi> for feare of infecting: <hi>and doe good,</hi> for feare of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: <hi>Seeke peace,</hi> for feare of wanting it; <hi>and purſue it,</hi> for feare of loſing it. The two firſt Precepts are the dutie of words, for words muſt firſt be regulated, before workes can bee actuated; and they are both Negative; <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill: and thy lips from ſpeaking guile:</hi> for it is not required of the tongue to be Eloquent; or of the lips to deliver Oracles: It is enough in the tongue, if it be not irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſuperiours, nor detracting from equalls: It is enough in the lips, if they be not charmes to deceive, nor Equivocations to delude.</p>
            <p>The other Precepts are the dutie of workes, and they are foure; where the Precepts of words were but two; becauſe we muſt be more in workes, then in words: and they are all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative: for it is againſt the nature of a worke,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16288:59"/> to be in the Negative: for ſo working ſhould be no better then idleneſſe: the two former are generall, as generall as Good and Evill; that if we meet with any thing that is Evill, our part is to Depart: for there is no demurring upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; No dallying with baytes: leſt ſtaying, we be ſtayed, as <hi>Eve</hi> was: Therefore <hi>depart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> If we meet with any thing that is good; our worke is, to fall a working; for vertue conſiſts in action, and is not ſo proper to bee talked of, as to be done: we never reade of any reward for good words onely; but all reward is onely for good workes: <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this;</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Therefore <hi>doe good.</hi> The two laſt Precepts are ſpeciall; whither we call them ſpeciall, as being particular, or as being excellent, for ſo is Peace: It is the legacie that was left us by Chriſt: and who would loſe Chriſts Legacie, for want of ſeeking it? Therefore <hi>ſeeke Peace, and purſue it:</hi> but not purſue Peace, for this were to make warre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peace, but purſue the ſeeking of Peace: for though it be ſaid; <hi>ſeeke, and yee ſhall find;</hi> yet it is not ſaid how long we muſt ſeeke before wee ſhall find: if therefore ſeeking Peace, you find it not at firſt, purſue the ſeeking it, and you ſhall find it at laſt. Agree with thine Adverſarie while thou art in the way; This is to ſeeke peace: Leave thine offering at the Altar, and goe firſt, and be reconciled: This is to purſue it, Or perhaps the counſell that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16288:60"/> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> may expreſſe it plainer: Be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: to bee inſtant in ſeaſon, is to ſeeke peace: to be inſtant out of ſeaſon, is to purſue it. Indeed if a man deſire long life, and to ſee good dayes; he muſt have a ſpeciall care of peace: whither it be peace in the humours, or peace in the Paſſions; whither Peace with God, or peace with men: they are all prolongers of life; and life is never ſhortened or diſquieted, but for want of peace in one of theſe, and therefore that you may not bee to ſeeke of long life; <hi>ſeeke peace, and purſue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, is there not great cauſe, that the feare of the Lord ſhould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all our words and workes, when ſo great a Majeſtie, as the eye of God is looking upon them? when ſo ſacred an Auditorie, as the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>15</label> eares of God are hearkening to them? <hi>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his eares are open to their cry;</hi> and can any man be ſo without ſhame, as to bee without feare, when he is the ſpectacle which God is pleaſed to looke upon? the ſpeaker which he vouchſafes to hearken to? But, O my ſoule, as it cannot but make thee feare, ſo it cannot but make thee joy; for what greater honour, then to bee the object of Gods eyes and eares? What though the world regard thee not, as long as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards thee? What are the eyes and eares of the world, but eyes and eares of ſcorne, or elſe of envie: of ſcorne, when in adverſitie, and of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16288:60"/> envie in proſperitie? but the eyes of the Lord, are righteous eyes, and are therefore upon the righteous: his eares, are eares of compaſſion, and therefore are open to their cry. But are not the Eyes of the Lord, as well upon the wicked? and what priviledge then is this to the Righteous? No my ſoule, his Eyes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Righteous, but they are againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and not onely his eyes, but his whole <hi>Face is againſt them, to cut off their remembrance <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>16</label> from the earth:</hi> O my ſoule, as thou conſidereſt with joy, the great force that is in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which drawes the eyes, and opens the eares of God: ſo conſider with trembling, the great force that is in ſinne, which not onely turnes away his Eyes, and ſtops his Eares, but makes him to bend his whole Face in furie; that if his favours of looking upon us, and hearkening to us, cannot winne us to feare him out of love: at leaſt the bending his Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us in anger, may force us to feare him out of terrour: for he bends not his Face to make a ſhew onely, as though he did but ſet a face upon it; but it is to cut off the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them that doe evill from the Earth.</p>
            <p>But may not the wicked erect Tombes and Monuments, that will preſerve their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for many Ages: perhaps as long as the Earth ſhall endure? and how then is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance cut off from the Earth? but from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16288:61"/> what Earth? is it not meant from the Land of the living? that in this may be ſeene the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent condition, betweene the godly and the wicked; for as it is ſaid here, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the wicked ſhall be cut off from the Earth; ſo it is ſaid in another place of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhall be had in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: and where is any everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to be had, but in the Land of the living? Indeed to have their remembrance cut off in this Earth, is not worthy of Gods threatning: It is the cutting off from the Land of the living, which is the blotting them out of the Booke of life; that is a worke worthy of Gods ſetting his Face againſt them, and this may well bee called a cutting off; not onely becauſe it ſhall come ſuddenly upon them, but becauſe they are never like to be heard; Alas! never like to be heard of any more, which can never be the condition of the godly, for they can never be ſo out of remembrance, but that they ſhall bee alwayes heard of God: <hi>For the righteous cry; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>17</label> and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is it like to be true, that the godly ſhall never be forgotten, when they ſeeme to be forgotten already while they live? for how elſe ſhould it happen, that they are more in trouble, in more trouble than other men, but that God hath caſt them out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? O my ſoule, their very being in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16288:61"/> is a certaine argument that God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them: if he had not remembred <hi>Job,</hi> and his righteouſneſſe, he would never have given Sathan ſo much leave as he did to trouble him. For indeed, though troubles be judgements to the wicked; and are as the firſt blowes to cut off their remembrance from the earth, yet they are but tryals to the godly, and doe but ſerve to make their remembrance be the freſher. Doe we not ſee how Trees are nipt with froſt and cold, and not ſo much as a leafe left hanging upon them, ſcarce ſo much as life remaining in them? but is it not to renue in them the freſher ſpringing, and to make way for fruits in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie? and ſuch are the troubles of the godly, they end in deliverance; and though they be bitter for the preſent, yet they make the joyes afterward to taſte the ſweeter. And what marvell, if God heare the cry of the righteous, being ſo nigh unto them as hee is? <hi>For the Lord is nigh unto them, that are of a broken <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>18</label> heart:</hi> Not broken with envie, as many are: Not broken with deſpaire, as ſome are; but broken with ſenſe of their ſinne, as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are; for this onely is the broken heart, to which God is nigh: and hee is not nigh it, in vaine: No my ſoule, it is good having God to be our neighbour; for hee ſaves all them to whom he is nigh; <hi>Hee ſaves all them that bee of a contrite, and humble heart:</hi> the lower they are in their owne eyes, the higher they are in his:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16288:62"/> and when their heart is broken with ſenſe of their ſinne, he makes it whole againe with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>19</label> of his grace. It is true; <hi>Many are the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the righteous; but the Lord delivers them out of all.</hi> For the righteous have many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore muſt needes have many troubles; but their troubles are not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, becauſe they have the Lord for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; if it be ſickneſſe, he makes their bed, in their ſickneſſe: If it be hunger, hee fills the hungrie with good things, when hee ſends the rich emptie away: if it be Death it ſelfe; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Domini ſunt exitus mortis;</hi> the iſſues of Death are all in Gods hands: and all this while, though their heart be broken, yet their bones are whole ſtill: They may have thornes in the fleſh, but <hi>not a bone of theirs is broken:</hi> for one of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>20</label> their bones is Faith, which though it may bee ſhaken, yet it cannot bee broken: Another of their bones is Hope, which though it may bee battered, yet it cannot be broken: and Patience is a bone, which may be vexed, but can never be broken: for in all of them, the Lord hath a hand; Hee upholds the righteous, that they cannot fall: Hee ſtrengthens them that they cannot faint, and as long as their bones bee whole, they are able to ſtand upright, and ſhrinke not for any burthen, that either the Fleſh, or the World can lay upon them. And though <hi>David</hi> in this, have an eye perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, of whom indeed there was not a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16288:62"/> Bone broken; yet what is ſpoken of the Head, may not incongruouſly bee applyed to the Members: and in the ſoundneſſe of Chriſts bones, the bones of the godly are kept from breaking. But the troubles of the wicked are of another nature; for, <hi>Evill ſhall ſlay the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>21</label> and they that hate the righteous ſhall be deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Their hearts perhaps are broken too, but becauſe they are not broken with ſenſe of their ſinne, but with ſpight and malice to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, there ſhall be none to make them whole, but their owne evill, ſhall be their owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and having none to deliver them, they ſhall be left deſolate, and without all hope of helpe. But ſhall not the wicked then have this good by being deſolate, that as they have none to helpe them, ſo they have none to hurt them? Alas! it needes not, they doe it faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough themſelves; for Sinne is a recoyling Poyſon; it turnes violently backe upon them that commit it: and it may be truly ſaid of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man, that he is <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of himſelfe. Though Righteouſneſſe of it ſelfe, doth not ſave the Righteous, but they need a Saviour beſides; yet wickedneſſe of it ſelfe deſtroyes the wicked, they need no other Deſtroyer: <hi>Perditio tua ex te, O Iſrael;</hi> Thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtion is from thy ſelfe, O Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And, O my ſoule, what great Examples there are to verefie this ſaying; <hi>They that hate the righteous, ſhall be deſolate.</hi> When <hi>Cain</hi> hated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16288:63"/> the righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> was he not thereupon made deſolate, and became a Vagabond, forſaken both of God and man? but in a higher degree; when the wicked Jewes hated Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, was there not a Voyce heard as of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſaying; <hi>Migremus hinc:</hi> Let us depart from this place? and thereupon left them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, without Prince, or Prophet; without Temple, or Altar, to this day? You may ſay perhaps, that <hi>Cain</hi> might eaſily be made deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, having killed his brother in a time, when there was no more in the whole world, but that one Familie: but how can the wicked bee made deſolate now, when <hi>Totus mundus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligno eſt poſitus;</hi> When all the world is full of them; and no Beaſts ſo herd together as they doe? But is it not, that Deſolateneſſe conſiſts not ſo much in want of company, as in want of comfort: was <hi>Job</hi> the leſſe deſolate for having company, of whom to ſay; Miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters are ye all? much leſſe ſhal the wicked be the leſſe deſolate for having company of whom to ſay; Miſerable Tormentours are yee all: for alas, all their companie, ſhall bee either Companions in their torments, or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions their tormentours: which can never bee the caſe of the godly: for though they be not ſo perfect, not to have their faults, yet they are ſo happy, not to have them imputed: for being Gods ſervants, <hi>Hee will redeeme them:</hi> though they be taken captive, yet hee will not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16288:63"/> ſuffer them to continue Captives: but rather then not redeeme them, he will give his onely Sonne to be their ranſome.</p>
            <p>But yet how can the godly chooſe but bee Deſolate, when the whole world ſcarce affords enow to make a company? and where then can company be had to keepe them from being deſolate? O my ſoule, they have Angels to pitch their Tents about them, while they live here, and hereafter they ſhall come to bee Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in the <hi>New Hieruſalem,</hi> where they ſhall have company enough: Prieſts, and Patriarks; Prophets, and Apoſtles; Martyrs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours; bleſſed Virgins, and chiefly the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin; but above all, where they ſhall ſee the Bleſſed face of God; whoſe onely ſight is able; whoſe ſight is onely able to keepe from being deſolate: and then at leaſt I ſhall bee as able to performe my Vow, as now I am ready to make it: I will bleſſe the Lord at all times; his Praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth.</p>

But if hee had ſayd; How terrible are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts; though it might have beene wonderfull in the degree, yet it could not bee wonderfull in the kind: for what wonder is it, if the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Lord of Hoſts bee terrible? but when he ſaith; How amiable are thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, O Lord of Hoſts; this is not onely won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in the degree; but in the kind, much more. For what can be more wonderfull, then that being Tabernacles of the Lord of Hoſts, they ſhould be amiable, and ſo amiable, as to be wondred at? But is it not, that God is in himſelfe ſo amiable, that all things of His, even his Terrours themſelves are amiable: his Tabernacles and his Tents; his Sword, and his Speare; his Darts, and his Arrowes; all amiable: Terrible no doubt to his Enemies; but amiable, wonderfull amiable to all that love and feare him: and great reaſon they ſhould be ſo; ſeeing they are all in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16288:66"/> and for their ſafeguard: though they be Tabernacles of the Lord of Hoſts to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet they are Courts of the Prince of peace to the godly: and this makes <hi>my ſoule to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>2</label> long for the courts of the Lord.</hi> For I deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be a Courtier, yet not as I am now; God knowes I am very unfit for it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods Courts are ſuch, they make any one fit, that but comes into them: they receive not men fit, but make them fit; and he that was before, but a ſhrub in <hi>Baca;</hi> aſſoone as hee comes into the Courts of the Lord, is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Cedar in <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, if his Tabernacles bee ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full amiable; they muſt needs be as wonderfull attractive, for there is no ſuch Adamant as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneſſe: Nothing that ſo powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and drawes all hearts unto it. And to know the meaſure of their Amiableneſſe, by the power of their Attracting, you need but looke upon my ſoule: For, <hi>my ſoule longeth, and even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord:</hi> which it would never doe, if it were not for their wonderfull amiableneſſe, that attracts, and drawes it by a kind of violence, indeed by a kind violence unto them.</p>
            <p>Every Amiableneſſe is not ſo great to make a longing: Nor every longing ſo great, to make a fainting: Nor every fainting ſo great, to make the ſoule to faint: Oh then conſider, how great this Amiableneſſe is, which makes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16288:67"/> my ſoule not onely to long, but to faint with longing? And blame me not for fainting, as though it were my owne fault, that would not reſtraine my longing: for ſeeing his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are of infinite amiableneſſe, they muſt needs worke in me an infinite delighting; and that delighting, an infinite longing: and what reſtraint can there be of that which is infinite? No alas, my fainting is but anſwerable to my longing, and my longing but anſwerable to the Amiableneſſe: If I had the offer made me, which was made to Chriſt, to enjoy all the Kingdomes of the Earth, but with condition to want the Courts of the Lord; this want would bring to my ſoule a greater griefe, then that enjoying, would give it contentment: for ſeeing his Tabernacles are ſo amiable, where he is Lord of Hoſts; how amiable muſt they needs be, where hee is Prince of Peace? and Prince of Peace he is in his Courts, though in his Campe he be Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>And that you may know it is not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my ſoule, that it faints with longing: (for indeed weake ſpirits are apt to faint upon every light occaſion) but that it is the very operation of the wonderfull attractive power, that is in the amiableneſſe of his Courts: ſee my Heart, and my Fleſh alſo, how they are drawne to long after the Lord, which they would never doe, if it were not for ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull amiableneſſe that is in him: for you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16288:67"/> may well thinke, it muſt bee an Adamant of a wonderfull attractive power, that can draw theſe heavy I rons of my heart, and my fleſh unto it: for indeed, though my Soule have a longing for the Courts of the Lord, yet my Body perhaps could be content to want them; there are Courts in the world, that might pleaſe my Body as well; perhaps better then theſe, but God forbid: God forbid I ſhould be one, to have my ſoule and body divided while they are united, to have my ſoule runne one way, and my body another: No, I am none of thoſe; but aſſoone as my ſoule longed for the Courts of the Lord; <hi>My heart, and my fleſh fell a longing for the living God:</hi> As my Soule lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the Place, ſo my heart, and my fleſh, for the Perſon: for my heart, and my fleſh, are of a duller apprehenſion; they muſt have a preſent Enjoying of that they long for, or they cannot be ſatisfied: but my ſoule is of a cleerer ſight, and knows if it can but come to the place where he is, it ſhall be ſure withall, to enjoy his preſence, and with his preſence, his Perſon. The Soule indeed is a ſpirituall ſubſtance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is natural to the ſoule, to long after ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; but the fleſh is an earthly ſubſtance, and therefore it is naturall to the fleſh, to long after earthly things: and as long as theſe two are linked in the Body together, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be working upon one another, alwayes ſeeking to draw each other to their partie: and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16288:68"/> if the Soule can draw the fleſh, to goe her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall way, then all is well: it is as it ſhould be: but if the Fleſh draw the Soule to goe her earthly way, then all is out of order; there will be no longing for the Courts of the Lord, for they are ſpirituall, and are never longed for, but where the Soule is predominant, and hath the leading. And this is the order in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> longing: firſt his Soule begins to long for the Courts of the Lord; and this is yet but a ſingle cord: but then comes in, the Heart, and the Fleſh too; and make it a Cord of three, that is impoſſible to bee broken. Indeed the Courts of the Lord are ſo exceeding amiable, that it is impoſſible, but every ſoule muſt needs long after them: but yet every ſoule conſiders not what belongs to this longing: but as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> longed to dye the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet was loath to live the life of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; ſo there are many that long for the Courts of the Lord, but are loath to live the life of ſuch Courtiers. They that be in Kings houſes, weare ſilke, and ſoft rayment, becauſe ſo it is fit for the honour of the place; and they that will be in the Courts of the Lord, muſt likewiſe weare rayment, that is fit for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the place: they muſt be cloathed with the ſoft rayment of meekneſſe, and humilitie; they muſt put on the robe of Righteouſneſſe, and the garment of Sinceritie; or becauſe they are Courts of the Lord of Hoſts: their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16288:68"/> muſt rather be in Armour, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it; they muſt take the ſhield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit; and if they come thus Cloathed, and thus Armed, they may juſtly then be ſaid, to long for the Courts of the Lord: but if they weare not theſe garmens, their longing will prove but a falſe conception, and they ſhall heare it ſaid: Friend, what makeſt thou here, without a Wedding garment?</p>
            <p>If my God were, as the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that have bodyes, but live not; that have eares, but heare not; my heart, and my fleſh, would then never cry after him, that could not heare them: but now that he is a living God, and hath eares to heare; how can they now forbeare to cry after him, that cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him? for alas, if hee ſhould leave them, what would become of them? what would my heart be, but as a dead corps; and what would my fleſh be, but as the Coffin?</p>
            <p>Thou affordeſt, O Lord, thy meaneſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <label type="milestone">

Alas! O Lord, if thou wilt not afford me thine Altars, for places of pleaſure; at leaſt afford them to me for places of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that if I cannot make them a Neſt for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16288:69"/> my young ones; my humble Meditations, and my penitent ſubmiſſions; at leaſt I may offer upon them, the ſacrifices of Prayer, of praiſe, and Thankſ-giving.</p>
            <p>I knew before by thy Courts, thou wert a King; and now I know by thine Altars, thou art a God; that confidently now I can ſay; <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, my King, and my God:</hi> that if I feared thee before, as Lord of Hoſts; I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee more now as my King: and adore thee more yet as my God; which as they are to thee, the tender of my dutifulneſſe; ſo they are no leſſe to me, the meanes of my bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> 
               <hi>For bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will ſtill be praiſing thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, how happens this? There were Tabernacles before, as belonging to a Lord; and Courts, as belonging to a King; and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, as belonging to a God: and now to be but a Houſe, as belonging to a private man? and ſo all this great Riſing to end in a Fall? No, my ſoule, it is no Fall: it is an aggregation rather of all the other; for where his Tabernacles did but ſerve to ſhew his Power: his Courts but to ſhew his Majeſtie, his Altars, but to ſhew his Deitie; his Houſe ſerves to ſhew them all: for in his Houſe there will bee ſtill prayſing him: and his Praiſe and Glory is the ſumme of all. Or is it, that to dwell in Gods houſe, is a kind of appropriating him to our ſelves, ſeeing his Tabernacles, and his Courts, lye open to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16288:69"/> his Houſe, open to none but his ſervants: and ſeeing in the neereneſſe to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him, conſiſts all true bleſſedneſſe; therefore, Bleſſed are they that dwell in his Houſe. But how dwell in it? Not to looke in ſometimes, as we paſſe by; or to ſtay in it a time, as we doe at an Inne; but to be conſtant abiders in it day and night, as to which we have devoted our ſelves, and vowed our ſervice.</p>
            <p>But it may be doubted, when <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in Gods houſe:</hi> What Dwelling it is he meanes; whither dwelling in it, as Tenants, or as ſervants? for if as Tenants, it is like there is ſome Rent to be paid, and there is ſmall Bleſſedneſſe in paying of Rent: It would be a more bleſſed thing, if they could dwell in his Houſe, and pay him no Rent. If as ſervants, it is like there is ſome worke to bee done, and there is ſmall bleſſedneſſe in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: It would be a more bleſſed thing, if they could be his ſervants, and doe no worke, and how then comes any Bleſſedneſſe in, by dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his Houſe? Indeed take it either way, let them dwell in his Houſe as tenants, or as ſervants, and they ſhall bee Bleſſed: let them have Rent to pay, as Tenants; let them have worke to doe, as ſervants, and yet they ſhall be bleſſed: and that which may ſeeme moſt ſtrange, the Rent, and the Worke which ſeeme to hinder their bleſſedneſſe, is the very thing that makes them be bleſſed: for they are both
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16288:70"/> but one thing, both but praiſing of God; and praiſing of God is the onely thing, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Tenants, or Servants; whether Bond, or Free, will make them be Bleſſed.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a Dwelling that hath not yet beene thought of; a Dwelling indeed that makes the true Bleſſedneſſe: and it is, to dwell in Gods houſe, neither as Tenants, nor yet as ſervants, but as ſonnes: for neither Tenants nor Servants, abide in the houſe for ever, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sonne abideth for ever: and therefore though the Houſe of God ſeeme a meaner Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then his Tabernacles, and his Courts; yet to us, it is the more comfortable title, ſeeing it makes us to be ſonnes, which neither his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, nor his Courts can doe.</p>
            <p>But how appeares it to bee true, that they who dwell in Gods houſe, wil alwayes be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him? ſeeing it is but ſeldome ſeene, that ſervants be ſo forward to praiſe their Maſters? O my ſoule, it is not ſo much the good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſervants; as the infinite worthineſſe of the Maſter, that makes them to praiſe him: for when they ſee the admirable O economie of his Government, when they ſee how ſweetly he diſpoſeth all things in weight and meaſure, when they find him to uſe them more like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then ſervants; what heart can bee ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as not to praiſe him? and ſeeing by dwelling in Gods Houſe, they ſee theſe things continually; therefore they that dwell in his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16288:70"/> Houſe, will alwayes bee praiſing him.</p>
            <p>But is it not a ſtrange reaſon of Bleſſedneſſe, to ſay they are bleſſed, becauſe they are ſtill praiſing him? to be praiſed themſelves, might perhaps be ſome bleſſedneſſe: but what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe can it be to praiſe another? Indeed if that other, were but ſuch another as our ſelves, it could be none: but when that other is ſuch, as that there is not ſuch another, or rather not another at all, to praiſe ſuch a one, certainly muſt needs bee bleſſedneſſe, or there can bee none; and ſuch a one is God: for alas what are we, but that in him wee live, and move, and have our Being: Hee onely is All in All. O my ſoule, if it were not for praiſing of God, there had never beene Created ſuch a thing as Prayſe: at leaſt we may juſtly ſay, that God, and Prayſe, are as truly Relatives, as any that are found in either Art, or Nature.</p>
            <p>You may ſay then, It is like to bee an eaſie matter to be Bleſſed, if there goe no more to Bleſſedneſſe, but prayſing of God. Marke therefore how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>They will be ſtill prayſing him.</hi> It is not enough to praiſe him; it muſt bee a praiſing him ſtill, before it will make a Bleſſedneſſe, and though to praiſe God be an eaſie matter; yet to praiſe him ſtill, will be found a buſie worke; indeed to fleſh and bloud a miſerable worke; for if I be ſtill prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, what time ſhall I have for any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? O my ſoule, if thou make it not thy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16288:71"/> pleaſure, thy chiefe, thy onely pleaſure to bee prayſing him; thou art not like in haſt to come to Bleſſedneſſe. And marvell not that <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes thus under the Law; When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> under the Goſpell ſaith as much: <hi>Whether ye eat, or drinke, or whatſoever yee doe elſe; let all be done to the glory, and praiſe of God.</hi> And indeed, how can I doubt of attaining to Bleſſedneſſe by praiſing of God; when it is praiſing of God; that makes the Angels in heaven Bleſſed? for the ſeeing of God, would never make them bleſſed, if ſeeing him, they did not praiſe him: and praiſing him would never make them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if they did not praiſe him continually; crying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: for as we praiſe God here on Earth, with ſaying, O Lord God of Hoſts; becauſe here, he fighteth for us againſt our enemies; ſo wee ſhall praiſe him in heaven with ſaying, O Lord God of Sabbath, becauſe there he will give us reſt from our enemies.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> But if it bee thought that praiſing of God will not be enough to make Bleſſedneſſe, or not to make Bleſſedneſſe enough; at leaſt, take this with it, and it will ſurely be enough: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in God: and in whoſe heart his wayes are.</hi> For though our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, being our owne worke muſt needs be too weake to make a bleſſedneſſe; yet when our ſtrength is in God, this makes it his worke, and then our bleſſedneſſe hath a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16288:71"/> When we truſt to our owne ſtrength for Bleſſedneſſe, we are often deceived, indeed as often as alwayes; but when our ſtrength is in God, we may reſt ſecure; our bleſſedneſſe is upon a Rocke, and cannot be ſhaken. But then Gods wayes muſt be in our hearts: for what way hath his ſtrength to the heart, if his wayes be not in the heart: That's their place, if wee looke for ſtrength from him. Are we not in a continuall fight againſt Sin; and have we any ſtrength to fight, but onely in him? and will he take it well to be placed in a Wing? No my ſoule, he will ſtrengthen us no longer then hee is placed in the heart of the Battell: That's his place, if wee looke to bee ſtrengthened in him.</p>
            <p>It is not enough that Gods wayes bee knowne, if they be not walked in; nor walked in, if not embraced: and it is not enough to embrace them with the armes, which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feigned, and but onely complimentall; they muſt be embraced, with the two armes of the heart; Integritie, and Sinceritie: Integritie will embrace them all; Sinceritie will embrace no other. Though Gods wayes be many, yet they muſt all goe into one Heart; if any be left out, the reſt will not tarry; though they muſt be in ſingleneſſe of heart, yet they muſt not be ſingle in the heart; They are fruites that grow in cluſters, not one by one.</p>
            <p>There are many that have Gods wayes in

There are many that have Gods wayes in their hands, they give almes plentifully, they diſtribute their bread to the Poore liberally; but becauſe their left hand knowes what their right hand doth; they have their reward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. They that have Gods wayes in their hearts, they onely are in the right way to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, and no rubbes of the world can turne them out of the way.

            </p>
            <p>If my ſtrength were not in God, I ſhould not dare to call upon him, being Lord of Hoſts: but now that my ſtrength is in him, and that I know hee is Lord of Hoſts for me, and not againſt me: a Shield to me, a Sword onely to my enemies: now I have confidence to ſay: <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, heare my prayer: give eare, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16288:73"/> to Faith, the onely thing that makes the true Iſraelite.</p>
            <p>But yet what good will it doe me, that God heare my prayer, and give eare unto it, if he be ſtill averſe, and turne away his Face? O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Behold, O Lord, our ſhield, and looke upon the face of thine anoynted:</hi> For I ſhall never come to looke upon thy Face, if thou vouchſafe not firſt, to looke upon mine: if thou afford me not as well the benefit of thine Eyes, to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as the favour of thine Eares to heare me; I ſhall be left onely, to a bare expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but never come to the happineſſe of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when thou vouchſafeſt to looke upon my face; that looke of thine, hath an influence of all true bleſſedneſſe, and makes me find what a happineſſe it is, to have the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> for my ſhield.</p>
            <p>But it ſhould ſeeme that this Prayer belongs onely to <hi>David,</hi> or at leaſt to Kings, who like <hi>David</hi> are the Lords anoynted, and what is it then to us that are private perſons? It is true indeed, that Kings are the Lords anoynted in a ſpeciall manner: but yet every child of God is his anoynted too; for why elſe is it ſaid of Chriſt, that he was anoynted with the oyle of gladneſſe, above his fellowes; if it bee not that his fellowes, meaning the children of God, be anoynted too? Anoynted no doubt with the oyle of Grace; but to bee anoynted with the oyle of gladneſſe, is the very thing I pray for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16288:73"/> here: the very thing, that makes mee long ſo much for the Courts of the Lord: <hi>For one day <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>10</label> in his courts, is better then a thouſand:</hi> It is not ſo much the length of time, as the meaſure of joy that makes the bleſſedneſſe: Or is it, that one day which ſhall never end; as the day is in Gods Courts, is better than a thouſand which have an end, as all the dayes of this world are. If he had ſaid, one day in his Courts, is as good as a thouſand; though this had beene a mighty odds, yet it had bin but a thouſand to one, there had at leaſt beene ſome proportion: but when he ſaith; One day in his Courts, is beter than a thouſand; this ſeemes to exceed all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of compariſon, and leaves no place for any proportion. Indeed one day in his Courts, gives ſeiſin of Eternitie, where a Thouſand that are ſpent any where elſe, are but ſteps of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. If I be but one day in his Courts, I ſhall ſee that which will bee a joy unto mee, all the dayes of my life: where if I be a thouſand in any other Courts; I ſhall ſee nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and vexation of ſpirit, that which will grieve me to thinke of, as often as I remember it. And as it is true in reſpect of Time; ſo it is no leſſe true in reſpect of Place: For, <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a doore-keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe.</hi> But is it ſuch a diſparagement to be a Doore-keeper? What was the Angell with the flaming Sword, but the Doore-keeper of Paradiſe? and is there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16288:74"/> not a conceit, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is the Doore-keeper of Heaven? Which though it be a vaine conceit, yet it may leade us to this congruous interpretation of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech, to conceive as if he ſaid, that hee had rather be Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the houſe of God, then be <hi>Annas,</hi> or <hi>Caiphas,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Herod.</hi> Indeed in the ſence that Chriſt is a Doore; <hi>David</hi> may well bee content to be a Doore-keeper: and though in Gods Houſe, there bee many Manſions; yet ſeeing all of them are glorious, even the Doore-keepers place is not without its glory. But if you thinke the Office to be meane: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then whoſe Officer hee is: for even a Doore-keeper is an officer in Gods houſe; and God never diſplaceth his Officers, unleſſe it be to advance them to a higher: Where in the Courts of Princes, the greateſt Officers are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times diſplaced; turn'd off often with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. However it be, it ſhewes not onely the great glory of Gods Houſe, but the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of <hi>Davids</hi> heart; and that he is not of the ambitious humour of the Mother of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> ſonnes, whom no place would ſerve for her ſonnes, but to have one of them ſit at his Right hand, the other at his left. O gracious God, grant me but a Doore-keepers place in thy houſe, and I will never aſpire after any higher roome: Not that I deſire, to let in, and keepe out whom I pleaſe, but that I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have liberty to walke in thy houſe, and to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16288:74"/> enjoy thy Preſence, in whoſe preſence is the fulneſſe of Joy for evermore. What are the Tents of wickedneſſe, but like Caves that have no light, and like Vineyards that have no Fences? and is there any compariſon to bee made betweene ſuch Tents; and the meaneſt place in the Houſe of God, where God not onely affordeth Light, but is Himſelfe the Light; Not onely is a Defendour, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it ſelfe? <hi>For the Lord is a Sunne and ſhield; the Lord will give grace and glory.</hi> I had heard <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> before, that <hi>In ſole poſuit Tabernaculum ſuum:</hi> God hath placed his Tabernacle in the Sunne; But I never knew he was himſelfe a Sunne till now: but what Sunne? Not the Sunne that is but the child of light, but the Sunne who is the Father of Lights: Not the Sunne that was not, till three dayes after it was light; but the Sunne that was before ever any light was made; Not the Sunne which the Heathen commit Idolatrie in worſhipping; but the Sunne whom it is Idolatrie not to worſhip. Oh that the Heathen would all worſhip this Sunne: it ſhould not then be ſaid; <hi>Plures adorant Solem orientem, quam occidentem:</hi> That more worſhip the Sunne riſing, then ſetting: for this Sunne once Riſen, never ſets againe; once ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is never any more Ecclipſed. Oh then vouchſafe, O God, if thou be a Sunne, to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my darkneſſe; if a ſhield, to protect my weakneſſe: if thou bee a Sunne, warme my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16288:75"/> ſoule with the beames of Devotion; if a ſhield, defend my ſoule from the blowes of Temptation: if thou be a Sunne, O ſhine upon me, with the light of thy Countenance; if a Shield, O ſtand betweene me, and the aſſaults of Sathan; for alas, O Lord, I am darkneſſe, and weakneſſe, the Anvile of temptations, the very Butt of Sathan, if thou bee not a Sunne, and a Shield unto mee. O my ſoule, God will doe more then this; <hi>Hee will give grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Grace to be a Shield unto us, and Glory to be a Sunne unto us; Hee will give Grace to prevent us, and Glory to follow us: Grace, to walke uprightly; and Glory, if walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly: Grace for a foundation to Glory, and Glory for a Crowne to Grace: and if theſe things bee not enough, hee will doe more yet: Doe thou but walke uprightly, and what good things ſoever there are in Gods gift, they ſhall all be given thee: for <hi>No good thing will God with-hold from them that live uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is this true, when God often-times with-holds Riches, and Honours, and health of body from men, though they walke never ſo uprightly? We may therefore know, that honours, and riches, and bodily ſtrength, are none of Gods good things: they are of the number of things indifferent, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes promiſcuouſly upon the juſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as the raine to fall, and the Sunne to ſhine: The good things of God, are chiefly Peace of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16288:75"/> conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, in this life; Fruition of Gods Preſence, and Viſion of his bleſſed Face, in the next: and theſe good things God never beſtowes upon the wicked, never with-holds from the godly; and are all caſt up in one ſumme, where it is ſaid, <hi>Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipſi videbunt Deum:</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the pure of Heart, (and ſuch are onely they that walke uprightly) for they ſhall ſee God. But is walking uprightly ſuch a matter with God, that it ſhould be ſo rewarded? Is it not more pleaſing to God to ſee us goe ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then walking upright; ſeeing ſtooping is the gate of Humilitie; then which, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God more pleaſing? It is no doubt a hard matter, to ſtoope, and goe upright, both at once; yet both muſt be done, and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are done, are done at once by every one that is godly; but when I ſay, they are done both at once, I meane not of the body: I know two ſuch poſtures in the Body both at once, are impoſſible: but the Soule can doe it, the Soule can ſtoope, and goe upright, both at once; for then doth the Soule walke upright before God, when it ſtoopes in humilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men.</p>
            <p>And what remaines now for <hi>David</hi> to doe, but to bring in the concluſion upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, ſeeing the Lord of Hoſts, though his Name be dreadfull, yet his Nature is lovely, ſeeing he is a Sunne to cheriſh, and a Shield to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16288:76"/> Defend; ſeeing he gives Grace and Glory, and with-holds no good thing from them that walke uprightly; Therefore bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</p>
            <p>And what remaines now for us to doe, but to receive this Concluſion of <hi>David,</hi> as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Demonſtration: and thereupon to walke uprightly, and to put our whole truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, through the merits of his Son Chriſt Jeſus; for then we are ſure, wee are in a ſure way, of attaining to Bleſſedneſſe, to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſedneſſe: that after this, we may leave our wondring, yet continue our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; <hi>How amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, O Lord God of Hoſts!</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>1</label> Soule: O how well they are fitted! for what worke ſo fit for my Soule as this? Who ſo fit for this worke as my ſoule? My body, God knowes is groſſe, and heavie, and very unfit for ſo ſublime a worke; No my ſoule, it is Thou muſt doe it; and indeed what haſt thou elſe to doe; it is the very worke for which thou wert made, and O that thou wert as fit to doe the worke, as the worke is fit for thee to to doe. But alas, I feare that by comming into this Body of earth, thou art become in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner earthy, at leaſt haſt loſt a great part of thy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16288:79"/> abilities, and wilt never be able to goe thorow with this great worke thy ſelfe alone. If to Bleſſe the Lord, were no more but to ſay, Lord, Lord, like to them that cryed, The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord: then my tongue alone would bee ſufficient for it, and I ſhould not need to trouble any other about it: but to Bleſſe the Lord is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent worke, and requires not onely Many, but very able Agents to performe it; and therefore my Soule, when thou goeſt about it, goe not alone; but, <hi>Take with thee, all that is within mee;</hi> all the forces in my whole Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, whether it be my Heart, or my Spirits; whether my Will, or my Affections; whether my Underſtanding, or my Memory; take them all with thee, and Bleſſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>And of them all, make uſe firſt of my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Forget not all his Benefits:</hi> for to remember his Benefits, is indeed a principall part of Bleſſing him. And the ſooner thou goeſt about it, the better thou art likely to performe it: for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe is a thing, that growes ſoone upon us, and nothing ſooner then forgetting of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: our Memories, are very apt to retaine Injuries, but very unapt for retaining of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: For as long as we remember a Benefit, we ſeeme to ſtand upon the rack of an Obligation to requite it: and who is not willing to come off a Rack, by any meanes he can; and then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by forgetting a Benefit, then by requiting
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16288:79"/> it? and perhaps wee thinke it a kind of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we can but forget wee owe it. But O my Soule conſider, that God expects no Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of us; he lookes for no requiting at our hands; Alas! He knowes we are not able: He takes it in good part, if but onely we remember his Benefits; and ſhould we not bee moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, they being ſo great, and ſo many as they are, if we ſhould not afford him ſo much as the remembring them? But as to forget all his benefits, were a wonderfull forgetfulneſſe; ſo to forget none at all, were as wonderfull a Memorie: for what memorie can be ſo vaſt, not to forget ſome, when they be ſo many? Indeed ſo many, that they cannot be numbred. And what then, O my Soule, wilt thou doe in this caſe? if thou canſt not chooſe but forget ſome of his Benefits, yet forget not all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; if thou canſt not remember all, at leaſt remember ſome: Forget not, <hi>It is hee that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> all thy ſinnes; it is hee that healeth all thy infirmities:</hi> Remember but theſe, and they will alwayes miniſter matter enough to keepe thee in worke for bleſſing his Name. For, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all my ſinnes, O my grievous, my mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſinnes, that I know not whether they bee more, or more grievous: whether their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or their Greatneſſe be the greater; is it not a benefit that may juſtly claime a prime place in my memorie? If it were but onely to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in puniſhing my ſinnes, it were a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16288:80"/> worth remembring; but to blot my ſins cleane out, and abſolutely to forgive them, and that freely, without any deſert of mine; Alas, without any poſſibilitie of deſerving; This is a Benefit that no Lethargie can forget, indeed a benefit that deſerves remembring in the higheſt degree. And yet perhaps, to forgive all my ſinnes, not a greater benefit, then to heale all my infirmities; (This being the chiefe worke of his Grace, as that of his Mercy) for ſeeing my ſinnes, many of them, and upon the matter, all of them, bee ſinnes of infirmitie: (for even wilfulneſſe, and preſumption, are of infirmitie) by healing my infirmities, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents me of ſinning: and is it not, as great a benefit, to keepe me from committing ſinnes, as to forgiue my ſinnes, when I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them? But, O my ſoule, meddle not with this high point of Heraldrie, to diſcuſſe, which is the greater of Gods Mercy, or his Grace: They are both an Abyſſus: it is worke enough for thee, and for all that is within me, to Bleſſe him for both: and for both indeed thou haſt juſt cauſe to Bleſſe him, ſeeing it is by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of both, that thou art able to Bleſſe him. If it were not for his Mercy, thou wouldſt want the materiall cauſe of bleſſing him, if it were not for his Grace, the efficient: but now that there is a concurrence of both together; Now that both he forgiveth all thy ſinnes in his Mercy, and healeth all thy infirmities by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16288:80"/> his Grace; Now, O my ſoule, what would it argue but extream ungratefulneſſe, farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a forgetfulneſſe, both in thee, and all that is within me, if thou ſhouldſt not Bleſſe his Name? For, O my ſoule, conſider the multitude of infirmities, to which thou art ſubject; thou haſt many ſuggeſtions of the fleſh: and thou art apt to conſent, and yeeld unto them, and ſtriveſt not againſt them by earneſt Prayer, and holy Meditations; This is an infirmitie. In thy prayers to God; thy thoughts are often wandring, and thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of other matters, farre unworthy of that great Majeſtie to whom thou prayeſt: or if not ſo, yet thou art quickly weary, thy ſpirits are drowſie in it, and thou hadſt rather be doing of ſomething elſe: This is an infirmitie. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou haſt infirmities in all thy ſenſes. In thy ſeeing, thou canſt ſee a moate in thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye, and canſt not ſee a beame in thine owne eye. In thy ſmelling, thou thinkeſt <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis odor lucri ex re qualibet;</hi> that the ſavour of gaine is ſweet from whence ſo ere it riſe. In thy Hearing; Thou art gladder to heare prophane, and idle diſcourſes, then ſuch as be ſerious, and holy: Theſe are infirmities: and, O my ſoule, if I ſhould cut thee up into as many parts, as an Anatomiſt, and examine the infirmities of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part; ſhould I not have cauſe, juſt cauſe to cry out with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> O wretch that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſinne?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16288:81"/> Who ſhall heale me of all theſe infirmities? for whether we call them ſinnes, and then God forgives them; or call them Infirmities, and then he heales them: they are to us, all one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; in God, all one kindneſſe; that as either of them is well worth remembring; ſo for both of them, we have juſt cauſe to bleſſe him, and to praiſe his Name.</p>
            <p>But, O my ſoule, as thou remembreſt theſe things; that both he forgiveth all thy ſins, and healeth all thy infirmities: ſo remember alſo their conſequences too; for upon theſe, there are great matters depending, as worthy to bee remembred, as the things themſelves. For alas my ſoule, thou wert by ſinne come to be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and the ſentence of <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> was paſt upon thee: but now, by forgiving thy ſinnes, this ſentence is reverſed: by healing thy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, thy life is Redeemed; it is taken out of the hands of the Deſtroyer, and put into the hands of a Redeemer; and a Redeemer not onely from Captivitie, but from deſtruction: for Captivitie takes away but onely thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but deſtruction would take away thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Being: and can it be thou ſhouldſt not keepe that in memorie, which is it ſelfe the cauſe, that thou haſt a Memorie? for what memorie couldſt thou have, if thou hadſt not a Being? and what Being couldſt thou have, if thou wert deſtroyed? and deſtroyed thou ſhouldſt be, if thou wert not Redeemed; and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16288:81"/> thou canſt not be, unleſſe thy ſinnes bee forgiven. This no doubt, is a conſequence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten; and yet perhaps there is a conſequence behind, of greater conſequence then this: For this (my ſoule) gives thy life but onely a duration; but there is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a comming, that will give it an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, <hi>he crownes thee with loving kindneſſe, and with tender mercies.</hi> To be madk a King, is an eminent favour: but to be made a King from being a Captive, where not onely the <hi>Quo</hi> is ſo conſiderable, but the <hi>Unde</hi> more; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſupereminent favour, and hardly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of expreſſing. And this is thy caſe, for where before thou hadſt fetters upon thy feet, thou haſt now a Crowne upon thy head: and not a Crowne gotten by violence, and worne with feare: but <hi>He crownes thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tender mercies.</hi> His kindneſſe would have made a Crowne good enough for thy wearing; but his loving kindneſſe, makes it a Crowne worthy of his giving. And if there be doubt, that his mercies alone may not bee ready enough, to beſtow this Crowne upon thee; yet of the readineſſe of his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, there can be no doubt: there can indeed be no doubt, ſeeing his loving kindneſſe, and his tender mercies, are the Crowne it ſelfe, which he beſtowes. For, O my ſoule, when I ſpeake of a Crowne, thou muſt not fancie to thy ſelfe, ſuch a Crowne as Kings of the earth weare:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16288:82"/> For Chriſt profeſſed plainly, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt thine be: but conſider the extent of Gods loving kindneſſe, and of his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and thou wilt find a better Crowne laid up for thee; then all the Kingdomes of the Earth put together, can afford. O gracious God, grant me the Crowne of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tender mercies; and all other Crownes I willingly lay downe at the foot of thy Throne, with the foure and twentie Elders: This onely is the Crowne to which my ſoule aſpires, for onely this Crowne makes ſinne, and Death to be my ſubjects; Rebellious ſinne, that can never be brought into ſubjection, but onely by this Crowne, O God, of thy loving kindneſſe, and tender mercies. Theſe indeed are Conſequences moſt worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but yet perhaps not apt to be remembred, for are they not of too high a ſtraine? and what the underſtanding doth not well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, the memorie doth not eaſily retaine: He will therefore deſcend to Benefits of a lower <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> ranke: <hi>He ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things; and renues thy youth like the Eagles.</hi> This no doubt is apt to be remembred, becauſe it falls within the compaſſe of ſenſe, for who is not ſenſible of good things, and ſpecially when they bee good things for the mouth? for, <hi>all the labour of man, is for the mouth:</hi> All that the hands worke for, and all that the feet toyle about, is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16288:82"/> all but for the mouth: ſo long as we may have greene Paſtures, and ſtill Waters; ſo long as we may have meat and drinkes, not onely to ſatisfie hunger, but to pleaſe the palate, wee care not greatly for any thing elſe. But, O my ſoule, theſe are not the good things that are here meant; and yet even this perhaps were worth the caring for, if it might continue: but alas, the dayes will come, when I ſhall ſay, I have no pleaſure in them: the time will come, when my mouth will loſe its taſte; and what good then will theſe good things of the mouth doe me? No, my ſoule, no feare here of old age; no feare of defect by reaſon of yeares: For, <hi>thy youth ſhall bee renewed like the Eagles;</hi> There ſhall be no looſening here of the ſilver Cord, no breaking of the golden Bowle; but as the Eagle by mewing her feathers, renues her youth: So thou (my ſoule) by mewing thy feathers, which is by caſting off this fraile Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of thy fleſh, ſhalt perpetually be kept by the powerfull hand of God, in a ſtate of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Indeed the life we live now, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part no life; for Child-hood is ſcarce come to it, and Old age is almoſt paſt it; no time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly remaining to life, but onely the ſhort time of youth: but the life that God hath in ſtore for them that feare him; not onely ſhall be alwayes, but ſhall be alwayes Youth, and no defect of Age ſhall be able to take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:16288:83"/>
            <p>But may we not now begin anew, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive rather, that when <hi>David</hi> calls upon his ſoule to bleſſe the Lord; <hi>and not to forget all his benefits:</hi> Hee meanes, he would have it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all his benefits; and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently falls to reckon them all up himſelfe; not <hi>ſingula generum,</hi> but <hi>genera ſingulorum;</hi> Not all in particular, but the generall Heads, under which, all the Particulars are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And he begins <hi>with forgiving of ſinnes,</hi> becauſe this is the Foundation, this is that which reconciles us to God, and which makes us capable of all his other benefits. But alas, what good will his forgiving my ſinnes doe me, if he ſtay there, and goe no further? for ſhall I not be committing of new ſinnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and ſo God ſhall bee alwayes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and never the neere? Never the neere, unleſſe hee be alwayes forgiving. To helpe this therefore, his next benefit, is the healing all my infirmities: for this takes away that aptneſſe to ſinne, to which wee are all of us by nature ſo prone and ſubject. But alas, what good will both theſe benefits doe me, if hee yet ſtay here, and goe no further? ſeeing I am now a captive, and already condemned to dye the death? for ſhould not my caſe bee like to theirs, who upon the ſcaffold aske the King forgiveneſſe, and when he forgives them, yet they are put to death nevertheleſſe. His next <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> benefit therefore is a remedie for this: <hi>For hee
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16288:83"/> Redeemeth thy life from deſtruction:</hi> Hee not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frees thee from captivitie, but preſerves thee from periſhing. But alas, what good yet will all theſe doe me, if he ſhould yet ſtay here, and goe no further? for when my ſinnes be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; when my infirmities healed; when my life redeemed; yet what am I more by all this, then as it were an <hi>Abraſa tabula</hi> at moſt, what have I more to take joy in, then every other ordinary creature? Hee will now therefore <hi>Coronidem imponere;</hi> give a benefit that ſhall perfect all: For, <hi>Hee crownes thee with loving kindneſſe, and tender mercies;</hi> Whatſoever is within the compaſſe of his loving kindneſſe; whatſoever within the extent of his tender Mercies; he will not onely make thee capable of it, but will freely beſtow it all upon thee. And who can deny, but this now is a perfect Inventorie of all the benefits, for which the ſoule hath cauſe to bleſſe the Lord: to bleſſe him in reſpect of it ſelfe; though there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits indeed to the body, for which the ſoule muſt bleſſe him too; for alas, the body is not able, not able of it ſelfe without the ſoule, and they are ſoone reckoned; for they may be reduced to theſe two; Suſtentation, and Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>For hee ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things; and thy youth is renewed like the Eagles;</hi> as much as to ſay, Thou ſhalt have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Epicure, and of the Stoick both at once; at leaſt, there ſhall bee no feare of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16288:84"/> hunger and thirſt: No drooping with Age, nor ruines of Time.</p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, let not my being in trouble, and oppreſſed with ſorrowes; make thee doubt of the truth of theſe things; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> theſe benefits: <hi>The Lord executeth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Judgement, for all that are oppreſſed:</hi> Righteouſneſſe to them, and Judgement for them: For as it is righteous with God, that his ſervants who are here oppreſſed, ſhould hereafter be comforted, and be made partakers of all theſe benefits: ſo it is his Judgement to the wicked, who are their oppreſſours, that they ſhould feele hereafter, the full meaſure of Gods wratth, as it were in their revenge. And this Righteouſneſſe, and this Judgement, he not onely deliberateth, and determineth; hee not onely promiſeth to the godly, and threatens to the wicked, and then leaves them undone: but he is perfect in all his wayes; hee is truly Reall, and puts them moſt aſſuredly in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at leaſt, he executes them <hi>Per ſe,</hi> or <hi>Per ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> either by himſelfe, or by his Angels: For indeed this part of his Judgement, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniſhment, is not properly in God <hi>Opus ſuum:</hi> and therefore no marvell if hee leave it, to be done by Angels, as he did at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> but though the Miniſtrie be theirs, yet the Execution is His: all the power is onely from him.</p>
            <p>And although the executing his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16288:84"/> and his Judgement, be <hi>inter Arcana ſua;</hi> things hidden from us; at which we may ſtand amazed, but can never underſtand them: yet he hath often-times revealed them to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, and ſpecially to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Moſes; For he made knowne his wayes unto <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>7</label> Moſes, his Acts to the children of Iſrael:</hi> For when <hi>Moſes</hi> went up to the Mount Sinai, and tarried there with God, the ſpace of fourtie dayes; we may well thinke that God in that time, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many ſecrets to him: and particularly made knowne his wayes, not onely his wayes in which he would have us to walke; but his wayes in which hee walkes himſelfe: and the courſe he holds in the Oeconomie, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of worldly affaires; why hee ſuffers the wicked to proſper, and why the godly to be oppreſſed. Theſe wayes of his, hee made knowne to <hi>Moſes;</hi> to the children of Iſrael, onely his Acts: Hee ſhewed them his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that was his Judgement: and he ſhewed them his wonderfull favours to themſelves in the Wilderneſſe, and that was his righteouſneſſe; but hee ſhewed them not his way, and the courſe he held in them: They ſaw onely the Events of things, they ſaw not the reaſons of them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; no more doe we: nor is it fit we ſhould: It is enough for us, enough for our comfort, that we know this of God in generall; <hi>That hee is mercifull and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>8</label> ſlow to anger, and full of compaſsion:</hi> Not that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16288:85"/> any ſlowneſſe is in God, but his ſlowneſſe is his Patience, and his Patience is out of compaſſion: for alas, if God were as ready to anger, as we are ready to provoke him to anger we had long ere this, been turned to duſt, and utterly conſumed.</p>
            <p>O my ſoule, here are foure properties ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to be in God; and are all ſo neceſſary, that we could not miſſe one of them. If hee were not mercifull, we could hope for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and if he were no more but mercifull, we could hope for no more but pardon; but when beſides his being mercifull, he is alſo gracious; this gives us a further hope, a hope of a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and then it will not be, what we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive, but what it is fit for him to give. If he were not ſlow to anger, we could expect no patience; and if he were but onely ſlow to anger, we could expect no more but patience; but when beſides his ſlowneſſe to anger, hee is alſo full of compaſſion; This makes us expect, he will be the good Samaritane, and not onely bind up our wounds, but take care alſo for our further curing. What though he chide, and be angry for a time: It is but our being patient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while with him, as he a long time hath beene <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>9</label> patient with us: <hi>For he will not bee alwayes chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; neither will hee keepe his anger for ever:</hi> No my ſoule, conſider the rule of Nature; that <hi>Nullum violentum eſt diuturnum:</hi> and you will find it true in the God of Nature: Mercy, and Compaſſion, are kindly, and naturall in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16288:85"/> God, and therefore theſe will continue, and never leave him: but chiding, and anger, are things, I may ſay, violent, and not naturall in him; and therefore it cannot bee that theſe ſhould laſt, or continue long with him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as unpleaſing to God to chide, as it is to us to be chidden; and ſo little hee likes of Anger, that he riddes his hands of it as faſt as he can: he is not ſo ſlow in comming to it, but he is as quick in getting from it: for chiding is a barre to Mercy, and Anger an impediment to Compaſſion: and nothing is ſo diſtaſtfull to God, as that any block ſhould lye in the way of his Mercy, or that the libertie of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſhould have any cauſe of reſtraint: and then we may be ſure, hee will not himſelfe lay a block in the way with chiding, nor be a cauſe to reſtraine his Compaſſion, by keeping his Anger. And we may the better be perſwaded of this, in that which is to come, by taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that which is paſt: For, <hi>Hee hath not dealt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>10</label> with us, after our ſinnes; neither rewarded us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our iniquities.</hi> Though he have chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yet hee hath not ſtrucken: or if hee have ſtrucken, yet his blowes have not beene great, not ſo great to doe us any hurt, for there is mercy in his very Anger; and though we keep our ſelves within no bounds of ſinning, yet he keepes his Anger within the bounds of Mercy. Alas! O Lord, if thou ſhouldſt deale with me after my ſinnes; as I have uſed no meaſure in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16288:86"/> my ſinning; ſo thou ſhouldſt uſe no meaſure in my puniſhing, and what then could I expect to befall me, but utterly to periſh?</p>
            <p>But why is it that God hath not dealt with us after our ſinnes? Is it not becauſe hee hath dealt with another after our ſinnes? Another who tooke our ſinnes upon him: of whom it is ſaid, that God <hi>chaſtened him in his fierce wrath:</hi> and why did he chaſten him, but for our ſinnes? O gracious God, Thou art too juſt to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge twice for the ſame faults: and therefore having turned thy fierce wrath upon him, Thou wilt not turne it upon us too: but having rewarded him according to our iniquities, thou wilt now reward us according to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. O Deere Jeſus, let not thy painfull ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings bee made fruſtrate by my ſinfull doings: but ſo mediate betweene God and my ſinnes, that hee may turne away his angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from me, and looke upon me onely with the eye of his Mercy. And, O my ſoule, how canſt thou doubt of this, when <hi>As high as the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> Heaven is above the Earth; ſo great is his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that feare him:</hi> and who would wiſh for a greater mercy to bee in God, then this? But yet the diſtance betweene Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though great, and indeed very admirable great, is but a limited diſtance: and is there then a limitation, and a boundary of Gods mercy? May I not as truly ſay, as low as Hell, is beneath the Earth; ſo great is my ſinne in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16288:86"/> the ſight of God? and how then am I ſure, that Gods mercy is any greater then my ſins? and if not greater, how can it pardon them? O my ſoule, though the heighth of Heaven be limited, yet Gods mercy hath no limitation, for his Mercy is above all his Workes, and therefore above Heaven the worke of his hands. Or if hee ſeeme to ſet a limitation to Gods mercy, is it not perhaps, becauſe there is ſome ſinne that is not capable of his Mercy? for ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven, either in this world, or in the world to come. But, O my ſoule, though Gods mercy bee without limitation, yet let it not make thee the bolder to ſinne: for though it be ſo great, yet it is ſo great to none, but to them that feare him: for to them that feare him not, it is not ſo great; Alas! it is not great at all: Alas! it will be none at all; but if thou feare him, and to feare him, is to feare to ſinne: then thy ſinne can never be ſo great, but that Gods mercy, which is as high as Heaven, will bring thee to bee admitted into the kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But if you thinke this diſtance of height, from Earth to Heaven, not ſufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the greatneſſe of Gods mercy; then take the diſtance of length, from Eaſt to Weſt: <hi>For as farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; ſo farre <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>12</label> hath he removed our ſinnes from us:</hi> that if the Eaſt, and the Weſt, can never come to meet
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16288:87"/> together; no more ſhall our ſinnes bee ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come againſt us in the ſight of God. But alas, this gives not ſo good ſatisfaction as the other: for though the diſtance from Eaſt to Weſt, bee vaſt indeed to us; as to which our ſight cannot reach, though wee ſhould uſe all the Perſpective glaſſes of the world: yet what is this to God, who can as eaſily ſee from Eaſt to Weſt, as if they were hard by, and cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? But is it not that all Gods mercy to us, is onely in Chriſt: and may wee not then conceive, that theſe Diſtances are repreſented by the manner of Chriſts hanging upon the Croſſe; where his Feet, and his Head, ſeeme to point from Earth to Heaven; and the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hands, ſeemes to point from Eaſt to Weſt? But though Relation to Chriſt be not the ground of theſe expreſſions; yet it cannot be doubted, but that they ſufficiently expreſſe the greatneſſe of Gods mercy; ſeeing they are the greateſt diſtances, that humane apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is capable to conceive.</p>
            <p>But if you bee not ſatisfied with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſings from Diſtances of place; then take an expreſſing from the affection of Nature: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>13</label> 
               <hi>For as a Father pittieth his children; ſo the Lord pittieth them that feare him.</hi> And now let any that is a Father, examine his owne Bowells, how much he pitties his children, and then ſay; If Gods pitty to them that feare him, be not in a very high degree. Certainly if any Name,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16288:87"/> could expreſſe a greater pitty, then the name of a Father, Chriſt would never have taught us to uſe this Name in making our prayers. And who could be ſo fit to make this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon as <hi>David,</hi> who gave a teſtimonie of it in himſelfe, by making his moane; <hi>O my ſonne Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom, my ſonne, my ſonne Abſolom; would God I had dyed for thee; O Abſolom, my ſonne, my ſonne:</hi> that now it ſeemes, Gods pitty is matcht; and this example reacheth home, to expreſſe the greatneſſe of Gods pitty to the full: No my ſoule, it is too ſhort yet: for though the pitty of a Father may reach to be willing to dye for his Child, yet Gods pitty reacheth further; not onely to be willing to dye, but to dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: and not onely for a Child, but for his Enemies; for when wee were enemies, even then did Chriſt very God dye for us: that Gods pitty holds the ſupremacie ſtill, and cannot indeed be matcht; alas, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by any thing that is in man.</p>
            <p>But though there may be compariſon in the tenderneſſe of their pitties, yet in the abilitie there can bee none; for a Father pitties often-times a child, when he cannot helpe him: but Gods pitty, is alwayes active and powerfull, and never without releeving: that though it be commonly ſaid; <hi>It is better to be envied, then pittied:</hi> yet here it is not ſo: but it is a farre happier thing, to be pittied of God, then to be envied of men.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16288:88"/>
            <p>But whom is it that God pitties? onely them that feare him; and indeed Feare is a thing that deſerves to be pittied: for it makes the joynts to tremble, and puts the ſpirits in amazement. But O my ſoule, it is not ſuch a Feare that is here meant; but this Feare is all one, I may ſay with love, and differs but in the Object: for looking upon Gods Juſtice wee feare him: and looking upon his Mercy wee love him: although wee love him for his Juſtice too, and wee feare him for his Mercie too: for as there is Mercie with him, that hee may be feared; ſo there is Juſtice with him that he may be loved.</p>
            <p>But why is it, that God pitties them that feare him? Indeed hee hath cauſe enough to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>14</label> pittie them: <hi>For hee conſiders of what wee are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; Hee remembers that we are but duſt:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what is there in duſt to helpe it ſelfe, if God in mercy take not pitty upon it? When God lookes downe upon us, and ſees how foule we are growne, whom hee Created cleane: hath he not cauſe to fall a chiding, and to be angrie, yet when he conſiders of what we are framed, and that wee are but duſt; this is ſome cauſe againe, to make him leave his chiding, and not to keepe his anger for ever; that we may truly ſay, Our miſeries are our happineſſe: for if it be our miſerie, that we are framed of ſo meane a matter as Duſt; It is our happineſſe, that wee have the meanneſſe of our matter, for God to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16288:88"/> take into his conſideration, and perhaps this was it; at leaſt one circumſtance that made ſo ill for the Angels that fell, that God could find no excuſe of their ſinne in their matter; the more hee conſidered of what they were framed, the more he found he had cauſe to bee angrie; and therefore no marvell, if his anger to them continue for ever.</p>
            <p>But this is every ones caſe to bee framed of Duſt; and why then ſhould God pitty ſome, more then others, ſeeing they bee equally of Duſt, All? Is it not, that hee is the leſſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie indeed, for that they are but Duſt; but yet he pitties them not, for being Duſt; but for being Duſt, and fearing him: for if they feare him not, he never pitties them, but lets them goe on in their Pride, at leaſt in their ſecuritie, and make what they can of their Duſt: for they reckon upon great matters from their Duſt, and thinke they can improve it to a great heigth: but alas, what can they make of it, but to come to be graſſe, at moſt to get up to be a flowre, a poore fading thing, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>15</label> you gather it, or let it grow; whether the Sunne ſhine upon it, or the Wind blow upon it, it quickly withers; and once withered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a pittifull ſight to be ſeene, a loath ſome thing to be ſmelt; that where all the grace of it, conſiſted in the two Senſes, of ſight, and ſmelling, it is now offenſive to both: and is no longer carried in the hand, or worne in the

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what could more be lookt for of Duſt? being ſo light a thing as it is; that if the wind but paſſe over it; if you but blow upon it, it is preſently ſcattered and gone; and the place where it was, will know it no more. And ſuch is Man: his flouriſhing is but as a Flowre, as quickly withered as a Flowre, and as ſoone cropt off from his ſtalke as a Flowre: and alas, what good is in a flouriſhing, that ends in a withering? What happineſſe in pleaſures that have no continuance? O my ſoule, if thou wert thy ſelfe a tranſitorie thing, and wert not to continue; thou mightſt juſtly then looke after tranſitorie pleaſures, and ſuch as have no continuance: but ſeeing thou art a ſubſtance perpetuall, and immortall: O therefore looke after pleaſures like thy ſelfe; pleaſures that may laſt, and never come to the laſt, that may laſt and be durable: and not leave thee to the miſerie of <hi>Fuit Ilium, &amp; ingens gloria teucrorum:</hi> for <hi>Fuiſſe foelicem miſerrimum eſt:</hi> To have beene happy, and not to bee; to have flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and now to bee withered, is the greateſt miſerie in the world.

               <hi>Individuo;</hi> ſome perhaps as of a man; None, as of this man: or rather, ſome, as of a Name; None, as of a man. Or is it rather, that Man turned once to Duſt, his place will know him no more; for how ſhould it know one from another, when they are all ſo like? How know <hi>Dives</hi> from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when they have both the ſame face? ſeeing Death hath but one copie to draw all her pictures by. Or is it rather that Man once turn'd to Duſt, is blowne about with every wind, from place to place; and what knowes the place, when Duſt falls upon it; whether it be the Duſt of a Prince, or of a Peaſant; whether of a Man, or of a Beaſt? And muſt not Man then bee needes very miſerable; when Time, and place, the two beſt helpes of life doe both forſake him? for what helpe can hee have of Time, when his dayes are but as Graſſe? What help of Place, when his place denyes him, and will not know him? But O how vaine a thing is Man, to forget not onely the very matter of which he is made, but the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under which hee is made: and ſo to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, that God muſt bee faine to remember him of it: but much the vainer, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of it never ſo often, yet hee regards it never the more, but contenting himſelfe to be fading graſſe, at moſt a fading flowre; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeekes to improve his Duſt, to that true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidneſſe, which nothing but the feare of God
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16288:90"/> is able to procure, nothing but the pitty in God is able to effect.</p>
            <p>But now at laſt, if neither the Diſtances of Place, nor the Affection of Nature can make you ſufficiently conceive the greatneſſe of Gods mercy: then take an expreſſing in plaine tearmes; and this will certainly make you conceive it: <hi>For his mercy is from everlaſting, <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>18</label> Gods mercy bee ſo Everlaſting; yet it is ſo, but to them that feare him; for if thou feare him not, and keepe not his Commandements, then his mercy to thee, is neither from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, nor to Everlaſting: but if thou feare him, and keepe his Commandements, then his mercy to thee is both: and not onely to Thee, as though Gods mercy were onely a Perſonall benefit, and ſhould end with thy ſelfe: but it ſhall be continued to thy childrens children; <hi>Et natis natorum, &amp; qui naſcentur ab illis:</hi> to thy whole Poſteritie: O my ſoule, what an Inheritance is this, to purchaſe to our children? at leaſt if it bee not an abſolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; yet it is ſo ſure an Entayle, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16288:90"/> nothing but the want of fearing God, can cut it off.</p>
            <p>And indeed, why elſe hath God prepared <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>19</label> his Throne in Heaven, but to the end the godly may bee aſſured, that though they bee now oppreſſed on earth; yet thither they ſhall come at laſt, to bee with him in Joy: to bee there in Joy, for having obeyed him: when the wicked ſhall bee left behind to bewayle their miſeries for not obeying him. For though his Throne be prepared onely in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>Yet his kingdome ruleth over all:</hi> Over All, both Man, and Beaſt; both the Godly, and the Wicked; both bleſſed Angells, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits; and becauſe his Kingdome ruleth over all, therefore All ſhall ſerve him, and ſhall ſerve him indeed with feare, yet there ſhall be a difference, for the godly ſhall ſerve him with feare and joy, where the wicked ſhall ſerve him with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>And now, ſeeing God hath prepared his Throne in heaven; Therefore, O yee his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, inhabitants of Heaven, that obey his Commandements by the freedome of your will; Doe you begin firſt, and prayſe his Name: <hi>for you excell in ſtrength,</hi> and are beſt able to doe it. And ſeeing his Kingdome ruleth overall: Therefore all ye his Hoſts, his other Creatures that obey his Commandement too, though not by will, yet by inſtinct: Doe you ſecond the Angels in praiſing his Name. And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16288:91"/> then thou my ſoule, that partakeſt of both the Natures; Doe thou alſo, and with thee alſo, the Soules of all the godly joyne with them in his Prayſes: that ſo at leaſt there may bee a Conſort of Three, to Bleſſe and Praiſe him, who is a Trinitie in Unitie; Three Perſons and one God, to be Bleſſed, and praiſed, for ever, and ever; But to be bleſſed and praiſed, as by all the perſons of his Kingdome, ſo in all the places of his Dominion: which are Heaven, and Earth, and Hell: a Triplicitie too: for even Hell is a place within his Dominion: And for praiſing him in Heaven, the Angells will be ſure enough to looke to that: and for prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in Hell, let the wicked and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpirits looke to that at their perill: but for praiſing him on Earth; Thou my ſoule, and the ſoules of all the godly will undertake to doe that, at leaſt will pray continually to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, to be enabled to doe it: and when all theſe ſhall faile, or leſt they ſhould faile, when Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, when Time and Place ſhall bee no more: yet his Prayſe ſhall bee continued ſtill, by his owne Workes, which are his Glory, and his Power; his Infiniteneſſe, and his Eternitie; but above all, which is above all his Workes, the Workes of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and Everlaſting Mercie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut how can <hi>David</hi> ſay <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>1</label> ſo peremptorily; <hi>I will love the Lord:</hi> as though it were in his owne power to love whom he liſt? Indeed nothing is ſo voluntary as love, that it ſeemes to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the will: for then wee are ſaid to love a thing, when the will is inclined, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently bent upon it: and yet I know not how, there ſeemes nothing more conſtrained then love; for we often-times love a thing, which we would faine wee could forbeare to love; but that we are drawne to love it, by a kind of violence in the object: and therefore <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:16288:94"/> may well ſay; <hi>I will love the Lord:</hi> ſeeing both the cauſes of love are here met, a propenſion in the Will, and an excellencie in the Object.</p>
            <p>Man indeed is naturally a loving Creature, but doth not alwayes place his love aright: his love is then beſt placed, when it is placed upon the beſt Object; and what is that beſt Object, but God? If he place it upon Beauty, that fadeth: If upon Riches, they periſh: If upon Honour, that vaniſheth: If upon life, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth: but all theſe are in God, not onely in Eminencie, but in Continuance: In him is Beautie that never fadeth: in him Riches that never periſh; in him Honour that never vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth; in him life, that never waſteth; and therfore as the trueſt object of love, as the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt object of my love; I will love the Lord.</p>
            <p>But though all theſe Eminencies be in God, yet they would bee no cauſe for man to love him, if they had not a relation to man: for what cauſe of love? where there can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no effects of love: but ſeeing there is in them, not onely a Relation, but a Propenſion; not onely they are ready to bee imparted, but are imparted with readineſſe; what man is hee that will forbeare to ſay, that can forbeare to ſay; <hi>I love the Lord?</hi> And if all men will forbeare to ſay it, yet I will ſay it: <hi>For hee hath heard my voyce, and my ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> No doubt a juſt cauſe, or rather (indeed to a naturall man) the onely cauſe for loving of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16288:94"/> God. For of fearing him, of praiſing him, of worſhipping him, of magnifying him, there are other cauſes; but of loving him, no cauſe ſo proper as his loving of us: and the Benefits which he beſtowes upon us. For, love is ſo reciprocall a thing, that we ſhould hardly love God himſelfe, but for his Love to us; at leaſt for our opinion of his love to us; and wee ſhould hardly have an opinion of his love, if we had not a feeling of his Benefits: For what love can wee thinke is borne us by them, that are able to doe us good, and doe it not? but when we have a feeling of their benefits, and find they doe us good; then wee are eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of their love; and being ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who can chooſe but ſay, as <hi>David</hi> doth here; <hi>I love the Lord for he hath heard my voyce, and my ſupplication?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doe we love God, but for his Benefits onely? and if it were not for his Benefits, ſhould we not love him? Indeed to love God as we ought, is not to love him for ought, but for himſelfe onely, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had at all of his Benefits: but ſuch lovers wee are of our owne good, that wee ſhould ſcarce love our ſelves, but for the good, we are ready to doe our ſelves: and if we love God in the like degree, we thinke it perhaps to be love enough for him. But, O my ſoule, this is juſt the Divells love; I meane ſuch love, as the Divell thought to be in <hi>Job; Doth Job love God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16288:95"/> for nought?</hi> He hoped he did not, though hee knew he ſhould; and therefore was never in quiet, till it might bee tryed; and if hee had found it ſo, he would quickly have made <hi>Job</hi> leave loving of God, and fall to loving of him. But the hedge which God had ſet about <hi>Job,</hi> was not a hedge of proſperitie as Sathan ſuppoſed, but a hedge of Grace, and therefore with all his fierie tryalls, hee could never get other words from <hi>Job</hi> but ſuch as theſe; <hi>Shall we receive good at Gods hands, and ſhall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evill? Yes, O Lord, though thou kill mee, yet will I love thee:</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> did, and thus ſhould we doe: but God knowes, there is not ſuch a man againe as <hi>Job</hi> was upon the face of the earth. For alas, wee are commonly but of the Claſſis or forme, of which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>Wee love God, becauſe God loved us firſt:</hi> and it were well if we would doe but ſo: how much ſoever Sathan ſlights it, and ſeekes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it. Or is it perhaps, that <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes in the curioſitie of this diſtinction, that we doe not <hi>Amare Deum,</hi> but for his Benefits: but wee may <hi>Diligere Deum,</hi> without any conſideration of his Benefits had at all; and in this ſenſe, a naturall man may <hi>Amare Deum:</hi> but none but the ſpirituall man, <hi>Diligere Deum.</hi> But, O my ſoule, doe thou endevour to be of <hi>Jobs</hi> forme; to love God without diſtinction; and whether he heare thy voyce, or heare it not; whether he grant thy ſupplication, or grant it not, yet
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16288:95"/> to love him, and to love with <hi>Amando,</hi> and with <hi>Diligendo;</hi> and with any another Devotion of love, that can be expreſſed, or conceived. For it is indeed no true love of God, if wee love him for any thing, but for himſelfe; if we love our ſelves, but onely for him: as it ſeemes both <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, who for the love of God, left all care of themſelves, and were contented to have beene (if they might have beene) even Anathema's.</p>
            <p>But is this ſuch a Benefit to us, that GOD heares us? Is his hearing our voyce, ſuch an argument of his love? Alas! hee may heare us, and we never the better: hee may heare our voyce, and yet his love to us perhaps but little, for who will not give a man the hearing, though he love him not at all? With men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be ſo, but not with God; for his hearing is not onely voluntarie, but reſerved; <hi>Non omnibus dormit:</hi> his Eares are not open to every ones cry; indeed to heare us, is in God ſo great a favour, that he may well be counted his Favourite, whom he vouchſafes to heare: and the rather, for that his hearing is alwayes operative, and with a purpoſe of helping; that if he heare my voyce, I may be ſure, he meanes to grant my ſupplication; or rather perhaps in <hi>Davids</hi> manner of expreſſing, in Gods manner of proceeding, to heare my voyce, is no leſſe in effect, then to grant my ſupplication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now becauſe hee hath inclined his eare to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>2</label>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:16288:96"/> heare me; I will therefore call upon him, as long as I live:</hi> that if it be expected I ſhould call upon any other; it muſt bee when I am dead; for as long as I live, I have vowed to call upon God. But will this be well done? May I not in ſo doing, doe more then I ſhall have thankes for perhaps for my labour? Is this the requitall that God ſhall have for his kindneſſe in hearing me, that now he ſhall have a cuſtomer of me, and never be in quiet, for my continuall run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, and calling upon him? Doth God get any thing by my calling upon him, that I ſhould make it a Vow, as though in calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, I did him a pleaſure? O my Soule, that God might indeed have a cuſtomer of me in praying: although I confeſſe I ſhould not be ſo bold to call upon him ſo continually, if his owne commanding me, did not make it a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for hath not God bid me to call upon him when I am in trouble? and is there any time that I am not in trouble, as long as I live in this vale of miſerie? and then can there be any time as long as I live, that I muſt not call upon him? For ſhall God bid me, and ſhall I not doe it? ſhall God incline his Eare, and ſtand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to heare, and ſhall I hold my peace for the nonce, that he may have nothing to heare? Or ſhall I wave calling upon God, who I know both can, and will heare mee; and call upon ſome other, who I know not whether they can or no? Is Prayer worth any thing if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16288:96"/> it bee not in Faith? and can there bee Faith, where there is uncertaintie? O my Soule, this is a great ſecret, which we ſhould perhaps have never knowne, if God himſelfe had not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to us: that to call upon him, is not a trouble to him, but a pleaſure; not in us a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but a dutie: though it be our ſuite, yet it is his ſervice: it is indeed both our ſuite and ſervice: and though his glory be not the more by it, yet his glory is the more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by it; and as he is a jealous God, ſo of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as of his glory, his glory hee will not communicate with any other, any thing elſe perhaps, but not his glory: and this is all the glory hee can have from us, that wee acknowledge our owne weakneſſe, and his Power; that we call upon him, not onely as one that is able to helpe us, but as the onely One that is able to helpe us, for elſe we ſatisfie not his jealouſie: and if it be a true rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie; <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora:</hi> It is no leſſe true in Divinitie: It is in vaine to call upon any other for reliefe but God alone; if God alone be able, and willing to relieve us. Either therefore wee muſt ſay, that God is not able, or not willing to helpe us; or elſe confeſſe it at leaſt a great vanitie to call for helpe to any other.</p>
            <p>But if Gods benefits be the Motive to love him: why are not his afflictions as well a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not to love him? <hi>For is there any evill in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16288:97"/> the Citie, and God hath not done it?</hi> No my ſoule, the reaſon is not like: his benefits are all gratuitous, and come <hi>gratis</hi> from him: his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are as it were violent, and come forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from him: his Afflictions are puniſhments, or chaſtiſements duly deſerved: but his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are not Wages, or Rewards that are juſtly merited: and therefore we cannot ſo juſtly ſay, that croſſes and afflictions are caſt upon us by God, as that they are drawne upon us by our owne ſinne: for ſorrowes and paines, are as the Ecchoes I may ſay of ſinne: and according as this calls, ſo they anſwer: if ſinnes be but light, there is like to be heard, but a light reflexe of ſorrowes; but if they be crying ſinnes, hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and loude: what marvell if the Ecchoes be anſwerable, and that the ſorrowes of Death compaſſe us about, and the paines of Hell take hold upon us?</p>
            <p>But if it be doubted, by what meanes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and croſſes doe happen to us, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted by what meanes they muſt be removed from us: ſeeing there is none able to rowle away the Grave-ſtone of our ſinnes, but onely God: and therefore no meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move afflictions, but onely his Mercy: and no meanes of this meanes, but to call upon him. Doe Phyſitians uſe to come to a Patient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be called? and why then ſhould wee looke that God the great Phyſitian of our ſoules, ſhould come to helpe us, if we call not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16288:97"/> upon him? Upon him, O my ſoule, and upon no other: for of his Power and Will to helpe me, I cannot doubt, of others I may: For, <hi>the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> ſorrowes of death compaſſed me; and the paines of hell tooke hold upon me;</hi> and can I doubt of his power, that hath delivered me from theſe? Or can I thinke of any other, that could deliver me from theſe, but onely hee? Could any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the ſorrowes of Death, but hee onely who triumphed over Death? Could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny free me from the paines of Hell, but hee onely who put Hell it ſelfe to paine, and caſt Death and Hell into the Lake of fire? and ſhall I call upon any other to deliver me, but upon him onely, who I am well aſſured is able to deliver me? No my ſoule, but to leave no time, for calling upon any other; <hi>I will call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, as long as I live:</hi> Not for a day, or a moneth, but all the dayes of my life; even as long as I live. And how long will that bee? Alas! how long can it be; ſeeing <hi>the ſorrowes of Death have already compaſſed me about; and the paines of hell have taken hold upon mee?</hi> For what are the ſorrowes of Death, but ſorrowes like thoſe of <hi>Rachel,</hi> that would not be comforted, becauſe they were not? What are the paines of Hell, but paines cauſed by guiltineſſe of ſin that deſerves Hell? Paines not more in ſenſe of torment, then deſpaire of remedie? What is it for the ſorrowes of death to compaſſe me about, but as it were to beſiege me? and was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16288:98"/> it ever knowne, where they once beſieged, that ever they did raiſe their ſiege? Was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowne, where the paines of Hell did once take hold, that ever they did let goe their hold? and alas, in this extremitie of diſtreſſe, in this gulph of deſpaire, what hope could <hi>David</hi> poſſibly have, that ever hee ſhould be delivered? O my ſoule, the hope of <hi>Abraham: In ſpe contra ſpem credidit:</hi> Hee beleeved againſt all credibilitie; Hee hoped againſt all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; againſt all poſſibilitie indeed in the courſe of nature; againſt all credibilitie in the eye of Reaſon; and therefore he makes his moane to one above the reach, both of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>4</label> 
               <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee, deliver my ſoule:</hi> a ſhort Prayer for ſo great a ſuite; and yet as ſhort as it was, it prevailed, that if wee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred before at the power of God, wee may wonder now at the power of Prayer, that can prevaile with God, for obtaining of that, which in Nature is impoſſible, and to Reaſon ſeemes incredible.</p>
            <p>There are many ſhort Prayers recorded in the Scriptures, of which we may note eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally three: This of <hi>David</hi> here; <hi>O Lord deliver my ſoule:</hi> and that of the Publican in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> and that of the Thiefe upon the Croſſe; <hi>Lord remember me, when thou commeſt into thy kingdome:</hi> All three ſhort, yet all three Prevalent; that wee may know, it is not the multiplicitie of words,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16288:98"/> or the length of Prayers that prevailes with God; but the fervencie of ſpirit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the heart. Yet leſt it ſhould be taken as a reſtraint of longer prayers; and ſpecially, leſt it ſhould be a ſcandall to the Prayer which Chriſt taught us, and is much longer: we may obſerve withall, that each of theſe prayers, is but of one Petition in Chriſts Prayer: For to ſay, O Lord, deliver my ſoule, is no more, nor fully ſo much, as to ſay, <hi>Deliver us from evill:</hi> and to ſay, Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner, is no more, nor fully ſo much, as to ſay; <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes:</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Lord remember mee, when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome;</hi> is no more, nor ſo much, as to ſay, <hi>Thy kindome come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing <hi>David</hi> with his ſhort Prayer, prevailed with God, to deliver his ſoule: why ſhould I deſpaire of the like ſucceſſe of my prayers, to be delivered from my troubles? O my ſoule, I ſhould not deſpaire of the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as <hi>David</hi> had, if I could but pray with the like ſpirit as <hi>David</hi> did: O therefore, thou great God, that didſt inſpire <hi>Davids</hi> heart with a ſpirit of zeale: which made his prayers not onely acceptable, but effectuall: vouchſafe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to kindle in my heart, a fire of Devotion, that my prayers may aſcend unto thee, like the ſacrifice of <hi>Abell:</hi> ſo acceptable, that they may be accepted; ſo accepted, that they may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: and may make mee able to ſing this Allelujah of <hi>David: I will love the Lord; for he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16288:99"/> hath heard my voyce, and my ſupplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoule, me thinkes I ſee the Lord, as it were inclining his eare unto me; and I ſeeme to feele an acceſſe of force in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <label type="milestone">

If hee were not gracious, I could not hope he would heare me: If he were not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, I could not depend upon his Promiſe; If hee were not Mercifull, I could not expect his Pardon; but now that he is gracious, and righteous, yea, and mercifull too, how can I doubt of his Will to helpe me?</p>
            <p>But are there no others that are gracious, and righteous, and mercifull, as well as Hee? Are not the Saints, and Angels in Heaven? They are ſo no doubt, but not as well as hee; God forbid, wee ſhould once have ſuch a thought; They are Gracious, and Righteous, and Mercifull by participation onely; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16288:99"/> onely by having, as it were, ſome beames im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them: but to bee gracious, as the Fountaine of Grace; to be Righteous, as the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe: to be Mercifull, as the Authour of Mercie; there is none, there is none at all, neither Saint nor Angell that is ſo, but onely God; and therefore of Gods Power and Will to helpe me; of his, and of his onely, I can onely be aſſured. And if I erre in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, yet <hi>the Lord preſerveth the ſimple:</hi> he takes <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> not advantage of errours, where there is a good intention; yet not a good intention one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where the truth is manifeſt, and revealed: for then ſhould <hi>Uzzah</hi> have beene preſerved: but in matters obſcure, and not plainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there to ſerve God in ſimplicitie of heart; this falls within the compaſſe of Gods mercy: and ſuch he takes into his Protection. He gives them perhaps ſome reſentment of their errours by worldly croſſes, but yet hee denyes them not his aſſiſtance; and this I can ſpeake of my owne experience; For, <hi>I was brought low, and yet hee helped me:</hi> I was brought low, and in trouble, by the juſt provocation of my ſinnes; but becauſe I ſinned not in preſumption, but in ſimplicitie, at leaſt by infirmitie; the Lord hath had mercy on me, and preſerved me. Or, <hi>I was brought low, and hee helped mee:</hi> for then is the time of helpe, when we are brought low: and therefore God who doth all things in due time; when I was brought low, then he helped me.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16288:100"/> Wherefore, O my ſoule, let it never trouble thee, how low ſoever thou bee brought; for when thy ſtate is at the loweſt, then is Gods aſſiſtance at the neereſt; that we may truly ſay, Gods wayes, are not as the wayes of the world: for in the world, when a man is once brought low, he is commonly trampled upon; and nothing is heard then, but downe with him, downe to the ground: but with God, it is otherwiſe; for his propertie is to raiſe up them that fall, and when they are brought low, then to helpe them. That it is no ſuch hard caſe for a man to bee brought low; may I not rather ſay, his caſe is happy? for is it not better to be brought low, and have God to helpe him, then to be ſet aloft, and left to helpe himſelfe? At leaſt, O my Body; this may bee a comfort to thee: for thou art ſure to bee brought low, as low as the Grave, which is low indeed: yet there thou maieſt reſt in hope; for even there, the Lord will not leave to helpe thee.</p>
            <p>Or is it that he was brought low, was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, to ſeeme vile in his owne eyes; and then God helped him? <hi>For God reſiſteth the proud; but giveth grace to the humble.</hi>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16288:100"/> Not onely in mercy hee hath forgiven my ſinnes, but as if my ſinnes had been Merits, he hath made me alſo to taſte of his bountie. Hee hath dealt indeed moſt bountifully with thee, for where thou didſt make ſuite but for one thing, hee hath granted thee three: Thou didſt aske but to have my ſoule delivered; and he hath delivered mine eyes, and my feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: and with a deliverance in each of them, the greateſt that could be: for what greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to my ſoule, then to bee delivered from Death?

            <p>But can my ſoule dye? and if not, what bountie is it then to deliver my ſoule from that to which it is not ſubject? The ſoule indeed, though immortall, hath yet her wayes of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is one kind of death to the ſoule, to bee parted from the body, but the trueſt kind is to bee parted from God: and from both theſe kindes of death, hee hath delivered my ſoule: From the firſt, by delivering me from a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſickneſſe, that threatned a diſſolution of my ſoule and body: from the other, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering me from the guilt of ſinne, that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16288:101"/> a ſeparation from the favour of God; and are not theſe, bounties to give my ſoule juſt cauſe of returning to her reſt? It is true, it is the imperfection of life, that it is ſubject to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſickneſſe drawes mortalitie after it: but this imperfection is not here; for hee hath delivered my ſoule from death; and what is this, but to have perfect health? yet it is the imperfection of health, that it is ſubject to croſſes, and croſſes are a cauſe of teares: but neither hath this imperfection any place here, for he hath delivered mine eyes from teares; and what is this, but to have perfect Joy? yet it is the imperfection of joy, that it uſeth not to continue; as it is ſaid of the proſperitie of the wicked: They are ſet in ſlipperie places, and are apt to fall: but neither is this imperfection found here; for hee hath delivered my feet from falling: and what is this but to be aſſured of continuance? If then thou haſt ſuch health, ſuch joy, ſuch ſtabilitie; Health, not ſubject to ſickneſſe; Joy, not capable of ſorrow; Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, not obnoxious to falling: How canſt thou, O my ſoule; how canſt thou chooſe but pacifie thy unquietneſſe, and returne to thy reſt? But alas, the reſt thou canſt returne to now, is but a type of that true Reſt, when thou ſhalt reſt from thy labours; and when thy workes that now goe with thee, ſhall then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee. Thou haſt now but one day of Reſt for ſixe dayes of labour; but then thou ſhalt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16288:101"/> have an eternall Sabbath, without any dayes of labour to diſquiet it.</p>
            <p>But though this reſt cannot now bee had, whilſt thou dwelleſt in a reſtleſſe body, and thy body in a reſtleſſe world: yet there is a Reſt that is worth the having; and may onely, my ſoule, be called Thy Reſt: the reſt which conſiſts in the peace of conſcience: and to this reſt thou maiſt well returne, ſeeing not onely thou art at peace with God, as being juſtified by his Grace; but thou art in his favour alſo, as having dealt ſo bountifully with thee. And when thou returneſt to this reſt; to the end thou maiſt have ſome exerciſe to thy reſt, that thy reſting make thee not reſtiffe, <hi>I will walke <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>9</label> before the Lord, in the land of the living.</hi> For now that my feet are delivered from falling, how can I better imploy them, then in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? were they delivered from falling, to the end they ſhould ſtand ſtill and bee idle? No my ſoule, but to encourage me to walke: and where is ſo good walking, as in the land of the living? Alas! what walking is it in the Winter, when all things ſeeme dead, when the very graſſe lyes buried under ground, and ſcarce any thing that hath life in it, to be ſeene? but then is the pleaſant walking, when Nature ſpreads her greene Carpet to walke upon, and then it is a Land of the living, when the Trees ſhew they live, by bringing forth, if not fruits, at leaſt leaves: when the Valleys ſhew they live,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16288:102"/> by bringing forth, if not ſweet flowers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the ſmell, at leaſt freſh graſſe to pleaſe the eyes. But is this the walking in the Land of the living, that <hi>David</hi> meanes? O my ſoule, to walke in the Land of the living, is to walke in the pathes of Righteouſneſſe: for there is no ſuch death to the ſoule as ſinne; no ſuch cauſe of teares to the eyes, as guiltineſſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; No ſuch falling of the feet, as to fall from God: and therefore to ſay the truth, the Soule can never returne to its reſt, if we walke not withall in the paths of righteouſneſſe: and we cannot well ſay, whether this Reſt bee a cauſe of the walke; or the walking, be a cauſe of the reſting: but this wee may ſay, they are certainly companions one to the other, which is in effect but this; that Juſtification can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be without Sanctification; Peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and godlineſſe of life, can never be one without the other. Or is it perhaps, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> meanes that Land of the living; where <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are living, with the living God? but if he meane ſo, how can he ſpeake ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>10</label> and ſay; <hi>I will walke in the Land of the living;</hi> as though hee could come to walke there by his owne ſtrength, or at his owne pleaſure? Hee therefore gives his reaſon: <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and therefore I ſpake:</hi> for the voyce of Faith is ſtrong, and ſpeakes with confidence; and becauſe in Faith he beleeved, that hee ſhall come, to walke in the Land of the living;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16288:102"/> therefore with confidence he ſpeakes it; <hi>I will walke in the land of the living:</hi> and perhaps to ſignifie, that hee ſhall not walke there againſt his will: but that he endeavours, and uſeth the beſt meanes he can, that hee may walke there. For indeed if we endeavour not to walke here, with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we ſhall never come to walke with God in the Land of the living.</p>
            <p>But though I had ſpoken thus, and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently; yet I found my ſelfe in trouble, and affliction ſtill, which made me ſay in my haſt; <hi>All men are lyars.</hi> In my haſt indeed, for I <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> thought not of one man who was farre from being a lyar; and in whoſe mouth was found no guile.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes, that to give the lye, was not ſo heynous an offence in <hi>Davids</hi> time, as it is in theſe dayes, for elſe how durſt he have ſpoken ſuch words, that <hi>all men are lyars:</hi> which is no leſſe, then to give the lye to the whole world? And yet, no man I thinke, will challenge him for ſaying ſo; no more then challenge S. <hi>John</hi> for ſaying, that All men are ſinners. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, how ſhould any man avoid being a lyar, ſeeing the very being Man, is it ſelfe a lye? Not onely a Vanity, and put in the ballance is leſſe then vanity: but a very lye, promiſing great matters, and is able to doe juſt nothing, as Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Without me, yee can doe nothing:</hi> and ſo Chriſt ſeemes to come in, as it were, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16288:103"/> be <hi>Davids</hi> ſecond; and to make his word good, that <hi>all men be lyars.</hi> And now let the world doe its worſt, and take the lye how it will; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> having Chriſt of his ſide, will alwayes be able to make his part good againſt all the world, for Chriſt hath overcome the world.</p>
            <p>But though all men may be ſaid to be lyars, yet not all men in all things: for then <hi>David</hi> himſelfe ſhould be a lyar in this: but all men perhaps in ſomething or other, at ſometime or other, in ſome kind or other; Abſolute truth not found in any man, but in that man onely, who was not man onely; for if hee had beene but ſo, it had not perhaps beene found in him neither, ſeeing abſolute Truth and Deitie, are as Relatives never found to be aſunder.</p>
            <p>But in what thing is it, that all men ſhould be lyars? Indeed in this for one; to thinke that God regards not, nor loves not them, whom he ſuffers to be afflicted: for we may rather thinke hee loves them moſt, whom hee ſuffers to be moſt afflicted: and we may truly ſay, he would never have ſuffered his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> to be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſo exceeding cruelly, if he had not loved him exceeding tenderly; For there is nothing loſt by ſuffering afflictions; No my ſoule, they doe but ſerve to make up the greater weight of glory, when it ſhall be revealed.</p>
            <p>But let his afflictions be what they can be, yet I will alwayes acknowledge, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in any degree ſo great as his benefits:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16288:103"/> and oh, that <hi>I could thinke of ſomething, that I <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>12</label> might render to him for all his benefits:</hi> for ſhall I receive ſo great, ſo infinite benefits from him; and ſhall I render nothing to him, by way of gratefulneſſe? But alas, what have I to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? all my rendring to him, will bee but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more from him: for all I can doe, is but <hi>to take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon his Name;</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>13</label> and what rendring is there in this taking? If I could take the cup of Tribulation, and drinke it off, for his ſake; this perhaps might be a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of ſome value: but this, God knowes is no worke for me to doe: It was his worke who ſaid; <hi>Can yee drinke of the cup, of which I ſhall drinke?</hi> Indeed he dranke of the Cup of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, to the end that wee might take the Cup of Salvation; but then in taking it, wee muſt call upon his Name; upon his Name, and upon no others; for elſe wee ſhall make it a cuppe of Condemnation, ſeeing there is no Name under Heaven, in which we may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but onely the Name of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be ſome rendring to the Lord, if I pay my Vowes; and doe, as it were, my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance openly; <hi>I will therefore pay my vowes to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>14</label> the Lord, in the preſence of all his people.</hi> But might hee not pay his Vowes as well in his Cloſet, betweene God and himſelfe, as to doe it publickly? No my ſoule, it ſerves not his turne; indeed not Gods turne, but he muſt pay them in the preſence of all his people; yet not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16288:104"/> to the end hee ſhould be applauded for a juſt Payer; for though he pay them, yet he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay them to the full; but to the end that men ſeeing his good workes, may glorifie God by his example; and the rather perhaps, for that <hi>David</hi> was a King; and the Kings exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prevailes much with the people, to make them pay their vowes to God: but moſt of all, that by this meanes, <hi>Davids</hi> Pietie may not be barren; but may make a Breed of Pietie in the people alſo: which may be one myſticall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why it was counted a Curſe in Iſrael, to be barren; for he that payes not his Vowes to God, in the preſence of his people, may well be ſaid to be barren in Iſrael; ſeeing hee begets no children to God, by his Example. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo, the Vowes which <hi>David</hi> meanes here, was the doing of ſome meane things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in ſhew for the dignitie of a King; as when it was thought a baſe thing in him to Daunce before the Arke; he then vowed he would be baſer yet: and in this caſe, to pay his Vowes before the people, becomes a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie: for as there is no honour to a man, whilſt he is by himſelfe alone; ſo there is no ſhame to a man, but before people: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſhew that he is not aſhamed to doe any thing how meane ſoever, ſo it may tend to the glorifying of God; <hi>Hee will pay his vowes in the preſence of all his people:</hi> And hee will doe it, though it coſt him his life, for if he dye for it,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16288:104"/> he knowes, that <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lord, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>15</label> is the death of his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which is pretious, is commonly deſired: and doth God then deſire the death of his Saints? He deſires, no doubt, that death of his Saints, which is to dye to ſinne: but for any other death of his Saints, it is therefore ſaid to be pretious in his ſight, becauſe hee layes it up with the greater carefulneſſe. And for this it is, there are ſuch ſeverall Manſions in Gods Houſe, that to them whoſe death is pretious in his ſight, hee may aſſigne the moſt glorious Manſions. This indeed is the reward of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, and the encouragement of Martyrs, though their ſufferings bee moſt inſufferable, their tortures moſt intolerable; yet this makes amends for all; that <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints:</hi> for if it be ſo great a happineſſe, to be acceptable in his ſight; how great a happineſſe muſt it be, to bee pretious in his ſight? When God at the Creation, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon all his workes; it is ſaid, he ſaw them to be all exceeding good: but it is not ſaid, that any of them were Pretious in his ſight, and how then comes Death, to bee pretious in his ſight, that was none of his workes, but is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of his workes? Is it poſſible that a thing which deſtroyes his creatures, ſhould have a Title of more value in his ſight, then his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves? O my ſoule, this is one of the Myracles of his Saints, and perhaps one of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16288:105"/> thoſe which Chriſt meant, when he ſaid to his Apoſtles, that greater Myracles then he did, they ſhould doe themſelves: for what greater Myracle than this, that Death which of it ſelfe is a thing moſt vile in the ſight of God, yet once embraced by his Saints, as it were by their touch onely, becomes pretious in his ſight? and to alter a thing from being vile to be precious; is it not a greater Myracle, then to turne Water into Wine? Indeed ſo it is, Death doth not damnifie his Saints, but his Saints doe dignifie Death: Death takes nothing away from his Saints happineſſe, but his Saints adde luſtre to Deaths vileneſſe: and it is happy for Death, that ever it met with any of Gods Saints; for there was no way for it elſe in the world, to be ever had in any account. But why ſay I, in the world? for it is of no account in the world for all this: It is but onely in the ſight of God; but indeed this onely, is All in All; for to be pretious in Gods ſight, is more to be prized then the world it ſelfe. For when the World ſhall paſſe away, and all the glory of it be laid in the duſt; then ſhall Trophyes be erected for the death of his Saints: and when all Monuments of the world ſhall bee utterly defaced, and all Records quite raſed out; yet the death of his Saints ſhall ſtand Regiſtred ſtill, in faire Red letters in the Kalendar of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for if there be glory laid up for them that dye in the Lord; much more ſhall they bee
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16288:105"/> glorified, that dye for the Lord.</p>
            <p>I have wondered often-times, why God will ſuffer his Saints to dye; I meane not the death naturall; for I know, <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori:</hi> but the Death that is by violence, and with torture: for who could endure to ſee them he loves, ſo cruelly handled? but now I ſee the reaſon of it; For, <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints:</hi> and what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then, if he ſuffer his Saints to dye: when by dying they are wrought, and made fit Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels to be ſet in his Cavinet: for as God hath a Bottle which he fills up with the teares of his Saints; ſo I may ſay, he hath a Cabinet which he decks up with the deaths of his Saints: and O my ſoule, if thou couldſt but comprehend, what a glory it is to ſerve for a Jewell in the decking up of Gods Cabinet; thou wouldſt never wonder why he ſuffers his Saints to bee put to death, though with never ſo great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for it is but the ſame which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>The afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glory that ſhall bee revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will have a Glaſſe to view the Extent of this pretiouſneſſe; and plainly to ſee, how pretious in the ſight of God, the death of his Saints is; then look upon the revenge that is taken for it: for there is nothing that God takes ſo much to heart; and of which hee takes ſo ſharpe revenge, as the death of his Saints: to touch them, is to touch the Apple of his eye:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16288:106"/> and if the puniſhment of <hi>Cain</hi> bee not thought ſufficient, to make it appeare; at leaſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Chriſt againſt <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: <hi>O Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem; Thou that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Prophets:</hi> and it is thought by ſome, that the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was the rather haſtened, to revenge the death of <hi>James,</hi> who was called the Juſt: but how ſoever, this wee know, it was therefore executed, to revenge the death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was truly the Juſt: and may we not well take notice, that the death was exceeding pretious; when the revenge that was taken, was ſo exceeding furious? But why ſpeake I of Death, when I may yet doe God good ſervice in life: and if the death of his Saints be pretious in his ſight, certainly the life of his ſervants is not unregarded; For whether we dye, wee dye to the Lord; or whether wee live, wee live to the Lord: and though in this life, we cannot expect the reward of Saints; yet in this life wee may claime the reſpect of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and in this I claime an intereſt my ſelfe; <label type="milestone">

Although perhaps Thankſ-giving bee but the Act, and Thankfulneſſe the Habit: and it is the Habit that makes the Sacrifice, becauſe it muſt bee, <hi>Juge ſacrificium,</hi> A continuall Sacrifice: which the Act cannot be. And if there had beene a word to expreſſe the Habit of praying, as Thankfulneſſe doth of Thankſ-giving: perhaps Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have uſed it, where he ſaith, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> for who can doubt but hee meanes the Habit of praying, and not the Act? and where he ſaith; <hi>In all things give thankes;</hi>
