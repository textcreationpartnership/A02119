            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is a great happineÅ¿Å¿e for Å¿heepe to have a good Å¿hepheard, but a greater happineÅ¿Å¿e to have him both good and able; many Å¿hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are the one, and not the other; few are both; indeed none are both; None able to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from want, but onely the Å¿hepheard, who is <hi>Elohim Saddai;</hi> God All-Å¿ufficient. Kings no doubt are able Å¿hepheards, but yet not able to Å¿ecure from want; for we Å¿ee them often-times to be in want themÅ¿elves: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> an able Å¿hepheard, yet not Å¿o able, as to Å¿ecure from want; for who knowes not what want he was in himÅ¿elfe, when time was? Wee Å¿hall never be Å¿heepe Å¿ecure from want, till wee come to Å¿ay; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard;</hi> and then wee may juÅ¿tly inferre: We Å¿hall not want.</p>
            <p>Indeed God is a Å¿hepheard, as able as hee is good, and as good as he is able. <hi>For hee leadeth mee into greene paÅ¿tures.</hi> Not onely hee hath greene paÅ¿tures to lead me into, which Å¿hewes his Abilitie; but hee leads mee into them, which Å¿hewes his GoodneÅ¿Å¿e. Hee leades me not into paÅ¿tures that are withered and drye, that would diÅ¿taÅ¿te me before I taÅ¿te them: but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16288:7"/> he leades me into Greene paÅ¿tures, as well to pleaÅ¿e my eye with the verdure, as my Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with the herbage; and inviting me as it were to eate, by Å¿etting out the meat in the beÅ¿t colour. A meat though never Å¿o good, yet if it looke not handÅ¿omely, it dulls the appetite: but when beÅ¿ides the goodneÅ¿Å¿e, it hath alÅ¿o a good looke; This gives the appetite another edge, and makes a joy before enjoying. But yet the goodneÅ¿Å¿e is not altogether in the greenneÅ¿Å¿e. Alas, Greene is but a colour, and colours are but deceitfull things, they might be greene leaves; or they might bee greene flags, or ruÅ¿hes: and what good were to mee in Å¿uch a greenneÅ¿Å¿e? No my Å¿oule, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e is in being greene PaÅ¿tures, for now they performe as much as they promiÅ¿e; and as in being greene, they were a comfort to mee as Å¿oone as I Å¿aw them; Å¿o in being greene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tures, they are a refreÅ¿hing to me now, as Å¿oone as I taÅ¿t them. As they are pleaÅ¿ant to looke on, Å¿o they are wholÅ¿ome to feed on: As they are Å¿weet to be taÅ¿ted, Å¿o they are eaÅ¿ie to bee digeÅ¿ted; that I am now me thinkes in a kind of ParadiÅ¿e, and Å¿eeme not to want any thing, unleÅ¿Å¿e perhaps a little water, with which now and then to waÅ¿h my mouth, at moÅ¿t to take Å¿ometimes a Å¿ippe: for though Å¿heepe bee no great drinkers; and though their paÅ¿tures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greene, and full of Å¿appe, make drinke the leÅ¿Å¿e needfull, yet Å¿ome drinke they muÅ¿t have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16288:7"/> beÅ¿ides; and now Å¿ee the great goodneÅ¿Å¿e of this Shepheard, and what juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e there is to depend upon his Providence: for hee lets not his Å¿heepe want this neither; <hi>but hee leades them beÅ¿ides Å¿till waters;</hi> Not waters that roare and make a noyÅ¿e, enough to fright a fearefull Å¿heepe: but waters Å¿till and quiet, that though they drinke but little, yet they may drinke that little without feare. And may I not juÅ¿tly Å¿ay now; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard, I Å¿hall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this; for is it enough, that he leade them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greene paÅ¿tures, and beÅ¿ides Å¿till waters? May he not leade them in, and preÅ¿ently take them out againe, before their bellyes be halfe full; and Å¿o in Å¿tead of making them happy, make them more miÅ¿erable? Å¿et them in a longing with the Å¿ight, and then fruÅ¿trate them of their expectation? No my Å¿oule; The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of this Shepheards goodneÅ¿Å¿e, is more then Å¿o; Hee not onely leadeth them into greene paÅ¿tures, but hee makes them to lye downe in them; Hee leades them not in, to poÅ¿t over their meat, as if they were to eate a PaÅ¿Å¿eover, and to take it in <hi>TranÅ¿itu,</hi> as dogges drinke <hi>Nylus;</hi> but, <hi>hee makes them to lye downe in greene paÅ¿tures,</hi> that they may eat their fill, and feed at leiÅ¿ure; and when they have done, lye downe and take their eaÅ¿e, that their After-reckoning may be as pleaÅ¿ing as their RepaÅ¿t;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16288:8"/> and that they may be free from being <hi>Å¿olliciti de craÅ¿tino,</hi> for taking care to provide for to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, Å¿eeing they have a Market of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion round about them, or rather their meat ready dreÅ¿t to their hands for many dayes to come. O my Å¿oule, thus are the godly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, by the Lord their Shepheard; and though their paÅ¿tures may Å¿eeme withered, and dry in the eyes of the world; yet to them, they are greene, and pleaÅ¿ing, and give more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e to their hearts; then theirs whoÅ¿e Corne and Wine, moÅ¿t abundantly increaÅ¿eth. And now, O my Å¿oule, is it not time now to Å¿ay Grace, and to acknowledge a thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e for this plenty of my meat, and drinke? and can I Å¿ay a Å¿hortet Grace then this; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard; I Å¿hall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this; for if God be a Shepheard, will hee not Å¿heare his Å¿heepe? and if hee Å¿heare me; will he not leave me bare and naked? and how then can I Å¿ay; I Å¿hall not want? God indeed is a Shepheard, that will Å¿heare his Å¿heepe; but hee will <hi>Tondere,</hi> not <hi>Deglubere;</hi> Hee will take off our old cloathes, but it is to make way for new; and he takes them off, in a time, when we may well Å¿pare them; indeed in a time, when it is better for us to be without them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither is his Å¿hearing any cauÅ¿e, but I may Å¿ay Å¿till; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard, I Å¿hall not want.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16288:8"/>
            <p>And yet I Å¿ay Å¿till, there will perhaps bee want for all this: For is it enough to have food, and rayment? Is it enough to have eaÅ¿e and plenty? Alas! all theÅ¿e doe but Å¿erve for the body; there is no proviÅ¿ion here for the Å¿oule: and if the Å¿oule be not provided for; all the reÅ¿t, is but the care of <hi>Martha,</hi> troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things, and none of them needfull. But he that told <hi>Martha</hi> of her errour, is it like he will commit the like errour himÅ¿elfe? No my Å¿oule, his principall care is of the Å¿oule; for <hi>hee reÅ¿toreth my Å¿oule:</hi> but as he made mee <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>3</label> not a living Å¿oule at firÅ¿t, till hee had made the earth, and the fruits of the earth to Å¿erve for my living; Å¿o he ReÅ¿tores not my Å¿oule now, till he hath firÅ¿t ledde me into Greene paÅ¿tures, to Å¿erve for my Å¿uÅ¿tenance: for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e were it to give a life, and not a living? to give a Being; and not give meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Being? and was it not perhaps from hence, that ChriÅ¿t tooke his patterne; when he taught us, to Pray for daily bread, before wee Pray for forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes? But though he provide firÅ¿t for the body, which was made firÅ¿t; yet he provides moÅ¿t for the Å¿oule, which was given laÅ¿t: Hee but feedes my body, but he reÅ¿tores my Å¿oule: Hee miniÅ¿ters to my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but accidentall and outward things; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall to my Å¿oule. And why is it, that God provides more for the Å¿oule, then for the body; but becauÅ¿e the Å¿oule is of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16288:9"/> farre more worth then the body? for God is not as man, to take care of things out of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or upon miÅ¿taking: but hee takes care of things according as hee values them, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues them according as they are worth; <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid cura Deo de Bobis,</hi> Doth God take care of Oxen? Indeed the Soule, in compariÅ¿on of the Body; is of farre more value, then the worth of an Oxe, in compariÅ¿on of a man. O that wee could be Å¿o wiÅ¿e, as to know the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and worth of the Å¿oule! and to take care of things according to their values! we Å¿hould then certainly be more carefull of the Å¿oule, leÅ¿Å¿e carefull of the body then we are: and be more Å¿enÅ¿ible of that Å¿aying of ChriÅ¿t; <hi>What availes it a man, to gaine the whole world, and to loÅ¿e his Å¿oule?</hi> It may bee allowed perhaps to men, to provide firÅ¿t for the body, Å¿o they would provide moÅ¿t for the Å¿oule, as God doth here: but to provide firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t, for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and laÅ¿t, and leaÅ¿t for the Å¿oule, as moÅ¿t men doe; that I Å¿ay not, all for the body, and nothing for the Å¿oule, as Å¿ome men doe; This muÅ¿t needs be extremely againÅ¿t all good order: Å¿eeing it is Å¿o directly againÅ¿t Gods order.</p>
            <p>But to what is it that God reÅ¿tores my Å¿oule? It muÅ¿t be to Å¿omething that my Å¿oule had before, and hath not now: and Å¿o it is: Hee reÅ¿tores it, to its originall puritie, that was now growne foule, and black with Å¿inne: for alas,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16288:9"/> what good were it, to have greene paÅ¿tures, and a black Å¿oule! Hee reÅ¿tores it, to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper in affections, that was growne diÅ¿tempered with violence of PaÅ¿Å¿ions: for alas what good were it, to have Å¿till waters, and turbulent Å¿pirits! Hee reÅ¿tores it indeed to life, that was growne before, in a manner quite dead, and who could reÅ¿tore my Å¿oule to life, but he onely that is the good Shepheard, and gave his life for his Å¿heepe, which no Å¿hepheard ever did but Hee? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> layd downe his life, but he gave not his life; for he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have kept it, if he might: and he layd it not downe neither, as a Å¿hepheard for his Å¿heepe, but as a Å¿heepe rather for his Å¿hepheard: but this Shepheard gave his life for his Å¿heepe: Gave it, <hi>quia oportuit</hi> indeed, becauÅ¿e it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary he Å¿hould give it; but yet, <hi>quia voluit</hi> too, becauÅ¿e hee would giue it; for if it had not beene voluntarie, it could not have beene acceptable; and if not acceptable, never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have Å¿erved for a RanÅ¿ome; and if not RanÅ¿omming, no ReÅ¿toring.</p>
            <p>But is it not Å¿aid, The Shepheard was Å¿mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the Å¿heepe were Å¿cattered? and what was his Å¿myting, but the Giving his life? and had he not done better to have kept his life, then leaving it, to leave his Å¿heepe to Å¿catte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? O my Å¿oule, though they were Å¿catte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a time, yet it was but to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe with the greater joy: for though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16288:10"/> he left his life, yet he left not his Å¿heepe: but had a care of them, even in death; for hee had power to lay downe his life, and power to take it up againe: and as he layd it downe for his Å¿heepes RanÅ¿ome, Å¿o hee tooke it up for their juÅ¿tification.</p>
            <p>Every Å¿hepheard knowes that Å¿heepe are Å¿ubject to many infirmities, and knowes many infirmities to which they are Å¿ubject; and therefore is never without his Boxe of Tarre, as the beÅ¿t remedie in caÅ¿es of danger; but if the danger paÅ¿Å¿e his Tarre-boxe, and touch upon the life; he then gives them over, and lets nature worke: but the Lord is a Shepheard of another nature, above the power of Nature; He reÅ¿toreth the Å¿oule, when the life is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; hee hath wayes of curing, which no Å¿hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard knows of but himÅ¿elfe; and if other helps fayle, he need but to Å¿ay, <hi>Velo, Å¿is Å¿anus; I will, Be thou whole:</hi> and without any Tarre-boxe, it is a preÅ¿ent remedie. And may I not now juÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ay; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard; I Å¿hall not want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet perhaps there will be want for all this: for is it enough, that he reÅ¿tore my Å¿oule, and then leave me? What is it to reÅ¿tore my Å¿oule, but to put it <hi>in Å¿tatu quo prius,</hi> in the Å¿tate it was made at firÅ¿t; which, was after the Image of God in holineÅ¿Å¿e, and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e? and if I could not continue in this Å¿tate, when made in it, how Å¿hall I continue in it, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tored
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16288:10"/> to it? Hee will therefore Å¿upply this want too: for having reÅ¿tored my Å¿oule in righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; <hi>Hee will leade mee in the paths of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> that though left to my Å¿elfe, I tooke a wrong guide, and went aÅ¿tray; yet when he leades me, that is the way it Å¿elfe; I may be Å¿ure, I cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly goe out of the way.</p>
            <p>But alas, O Lord, theÅ¿e paths of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, have a long time Å¿o little beene frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all prints of a path, are almoÅ¿t cleane worne out; that it is a hard matter now but to find where the paths lye, and if wee can find them, yet they are Å¿o narrow, and Å¿o full of rubbes; that without Å¿peciall aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, it is an impoÅ¿Å¿ible thing, not to Fall, or goe aÅ¿tray. Even Å¿ome Angels, and thoÅ¿e no meane ones, were not able to goe right in theÅ¿e pathes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; but for want of leading, went awry, and periÅ¿hed. O therefore, Thou the great Shepheard of my Å¿oule, as thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed of thy grace to leade me into them; Å¿o vouchÅ¿afe with thy Grace to leade me in them: for though in themÅ¿elves they bee pathes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; yet to me, they will bee but paths of errour, if thou vouchÅ¿afe not, as well to leade me in them, as into them. O the comfortable pathes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paths in which <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and which walked in as they Å¿hould be, will bring us to a better ParadiÅ¿e, then that of our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16288:11"/> firÅ¿t Parents. For if God leade us in theÅ¿e paths; theÅ¿e paths will leade us to the place, where the Goats Å¿hall be put on the left hand, and the Å¿heepe be taken on the right, that now I am certainly come to the higheÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to Å¿ay; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard, I Å¿hall not want:</hi> for at his right hand is the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of Joy forevermore.</p>
            <p>But why is it, that this great Shepheard will doe theÅ¿e great things for me? Is it becauÅ¿e he findes me to be a Å¿ounder Å¿heepe, and to have fewer blemiÅ¿hes upon me then Å¿ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Alas no; for I am nothing but blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes, and unÅ¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e all over; but, <hi>Hee will doe it for his Names Å¿ake;</hi> For Å¿eeing hee hath taken upon him the Name of a good Å¿hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, he will diÅ¿charge his part, what ever his Å¿heepe be: It is not their being bad Å¿heepe, that can make him leave being a good Å¿hepheard, but he will be good, and maintaine the credit of his Name, in Å¿pight of all their badneÅ¿Å¿e: and though no benefit come to them of it, yet there Å¿hall glory accrew to him by it, and his Name Å¿hall nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e be magnified, and extolled.</p>
            <p>But now, O my Å¿oule, though I can Å¿ay, I Å¿hall not want: yet can I Å¿ay, I Å¿hall not feare? For is not Feare an inÅ¿eparable companion of Mortalitie? and can I then chooÅ¿e but feare, that know my Å¿elfe to be mortall, and know alÅ¿o what the condition is of being mortall?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16288:11"/> Not onely that I may dye, but that I muÅ¿t dye: and not onely muÅ¿t one day, but may this day; Alas, this very minute! I feare indeed when I conÅ¿ider my owne frailtie: but when I conÅ¿ider that the Lord is my Shepheard, I then am armed againÅ¿t all feare, againÅ¿t this feare of death it Å¿elfe: Hee that makes me to walke in Greene paÅ¿tures, and in paths of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and keepes me from want: hee alÅ¿o leades me by the hand, as I walke, and keepes me from feare: <hi>Yea, thou I walke in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>4</label> valley, of the Å¿hadow of death, I will feare no evill:</hi> Though I be brought to never Å¿o great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: though brought as low as the Valley of death, though brought as neere to Death, as the Å¿hadow to the body; though brought to walke as a ghoÅ¿t amongÅ¿t the dead, yet I will feare no evill. The Å¿hadow of death may perhaps be farre enough from it, for all our life, is but the Å¿hadow of death: but the Valley of the Å¿hadow muÅ¿t needs be cloÅ¿e to death, as being the very entrance to it; yet if I were brought to this doore of death, if brought within the doore, and compaÅ¿Å¿ed about with Death; yet for all this, for all that can be Å¿aid, or done, I will feare no evill. Will you not? will you not feare evill, when the evill is Å¿o eminent, and the danger Å¿o great? Is the face of Death no more terrible, but that you dare looke upon it, without feare? Though it be the reproach of the wicked, to feare where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16288:12"/> there is no cauÅ¿e of feare, yet not to feare where there is cauÅ¿e, can be no commendation in the godly. And why then will <hi>David</hi> Å¿peake thus, more like a deÅ¿perate man, then one that were well adviÅ¿ed? No doubt, <hi>David</hi> will give good reaÅ¿on for that hee Å¿peakes; As it were deÅ¿peratneÅ¿Å¿e, not to feare, where there is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger: So it were cowardiÅ¿e to feare, where there is eminent comfort: Lay then the comfort to the danger, and you will eaÅ¿ily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e <hi>David,</hi> for fearing no evill. You have Å¿eene the Danger, now heare the Comfort: <hi>The Lord my Å¿hepheard is with mee;</hi> For he is never abÅ¿ent from his flock: <hi>his rodde, and his Å¿taffe, they comfort mee:</hi> and may they not juÅ¿tly comfort me, when with them he is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a Å¿heepe, though falling downe the Å¿tee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peÅ¿t Praecipyce, or though already in the Wolfes mouth, or in the pawes of the Lyon. Indeed, if I had not my Shepheard with mee; Or if my Shepheard had not his inÅ¿truments with him, I might juÅ¿tly then be in feare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; but what evill can I feare now, when I have my Shepheard, and my Shepheard his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments; <hi>his rod, and his Å¿taffe;</hi> Both InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of comfort; and not onely of comfort, but of incouragement; both InÅ¿truments of preÅ¿erving.</p>
            <p>But is it well underÅ¿tood, what his Rod, and his Staffe meane? For, they may as well bee inÅ¿truments of correcting, as defending: and if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16288:12"/> of defending, there is then juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e they Å¿hould be comforts: but if of correcting, what comforts can they be? for what comfort can it be, to be corrected? O my Å¿oule, great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me, that know the nature of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, as I doe: for doe not I know, that whom he loves, he corrects; and therefore whom he corrects, it is a certaine Argument that hee loves? Indeed, if the Rodde and the Staffe, were in the hands of an enemie; I Å¿hould then feare them, as inÅ¿truments for my evill; but being in his hands that is my Shepheard; now they are but as my owne weapons put into an abler hand, that can better manage them for my good, then I could doe my Å¿elfe. Could <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> with his rod fetch water out of a Rock, and Å¿hall not God with his rod, bring comfort out of trouble? Could <hi>Jacob</hi> with his Å¿taffe paÅ¿Å¿e over Jordan, and returne enriched with heards of cattell, and Å¿hall not Gods Å¿taffe make me paÅ¿Å¿e over the Jordan of this world, and bring mee home with troopes of joy? Shall not his rod, though it wound me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me; when I know he wounds, but to the end hee may apply a PlaiÅ¿ter? Shall not his Å¿taffe, though it beat me, comfort me; when it is but to beat the duÅ¿t out of mee, that am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but duÅ¿t? But moÅ¿t of all, muÅ¿t not his rod needs comfort me, when it is his rod, that makes me lye downe in greene paÅ¿tures? MuÅ¿t not his Å¿taffe needs comfort me, when it is his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16288:13"/> Å¿taffe, that keepes me right in the paths of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e? Oh Å¿weet Rod, how can I chooÅ¿e but kiÅ¿Å¿e thee! Deare Å¿taffe, but embrace thee! Å¿eeing it is long of you, that his greene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tures, and his paths of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e doe me any good; for they would certainly doe mee hurt; his greene paÅ¿tures would pamper up my fleÅ¿h too much; his pathes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e would puffe up my Å¿pirits too much; If his Rod, and his Staffe were not uÅ¿ed as Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. And if you thinke this Å¿trange, that the paths of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hould puffe up the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Remember Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom there was given a thorne in the fleÅ¿h, leÅ¿t his walking in the paths of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hould puffe him up. But if the rod, and the Å¿taffe, in theÅ¿e Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, may not be Å¿ufficient comfort to take away all cauÅ¿e of feare; at leaÅ¿t, <hi>there Å¿hall come forth a Rod, out of the Å¿temme of JeÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> (indeed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in particular, a Å¿peciall comfort) that will certainly be Å¿ufficient againÅ¿t all feare, though I walke in the Valley of the Å¿hadow of death; for this Rod, as a Mountaine Å¿hall fill up all Valleys; and as the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, Å¿hall fulfill all Å¿hadowe; and as the true life, Å¿hall Å¿wallow up Death in victory. And is there not a Å¿taffe that will doe as much? the Å¿taffe upon which <hi>Jacob</hi> leaned, when he was a dying? when he was indeed in the Valley of the Å¿hadow of Death? O my Å¿oule, having this Staffe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to leane upon; this Rodde of the Å¿temme
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16288:13"/> of <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿e</hi> to be my comfort; I Å¿hall make my Å¿elfe unworthy of protection, if I Å¿hould feare any evill, though I walke in the valley of the Å¿hadow of death. For why Å¿hould I feare Death, which is but the parting of the Å¿oule from the body, Å¿eeing I cannot come to God with them both at once, but they muÅ¿t firÅ¿t bee parted one from another? My Å¿oule cannot come to the light of life, if my body bee not firÅ¿t in the Å¿hadow of death: indeed but in the Å¿hadow, for the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of death can never take hold upon it, if my Å¿oule be gone before to take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Light. O then vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe, O God, to bring my Å¿oule firÅ¿t, and after it, my body out of the Å¿hadow of Death, into the light of Life; and then I Å¿hall have cauÅ¿e, juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay, and to glory in Å¿aying; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard, I Å¿hall not want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be doubted Å¿till, how it can be, that Gods rodde, and his Å¿taffe, Å¿hould be comforts to the godly, then marke the iÅ¿Å¿ue, and Å¿ee what followes upon his Rod, and his Staffe; <hi>Thou prepareÅ¿t a Table before mee, in the preÅ¿ence <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>5</label> of my enemies: Thou anoynteÅ¿t my head with Oyle; my cuppe runneth over.</hi> For this is a Å¿ure rule with God, that his chaÅ¿tening alwayes ends in cheriÅ¿hing; if he Å¿trike with his Rod, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps breakes the head with his Staffe; he gives Oyle preÅ¿ently to anoynt it, and to make it whole againe. If he make mee to keepe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting-day to day, he allowes mee a feaÅ¿t for it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16288:14"/> to morrow, and then my cuppe Å¿hall runne over.</p>
            <p>Hitherto God hath vouchÅ¿afed to bee a Shepheard, and <hi>David</hi> hath beene his Å¿heepe; Now God will be a Conquerour, and <hi>David</hi> Å¿hall be a King. Now God as a Conquerour will beÅ¿tow favours on his friends, and diÅ¿gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon his enemies, and therefore now the Scene alters: where it was before in the field, it is now within doores; and where <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿pake in the third PerÅ¿on, he Å¿peakes now in the Å¿econd; <hi>Thou prepareÅ¿t a Table before mee;</hi> and this is to feaÅ¿t his friends: <hi>In the preÅ¿ence of mine enemies;</hi> and this is to confound his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. To prepare a Table before him, is it Å¿elfe a favour: but the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the favour is in this, that a Table is prepared before him, in the preÅ¿ence of his Enemies. For as there is no Å¿uch joy of proÅ¿peritie to the godly, as when their enemies Å¿ee the proÅ¿peritie they are in; it being a kind of revenge, that God takes upon their enemies, in their behalfe: Å¿o there is no Å¿uch Tragedie to the wicked, as to be made Å¿pectatours of the proÅ¿peritie of the godly; it being the greateÅ¿t affront, that can be to their expectation, to Å¿ee them advanced, whom they both hated, and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed. Could <hi>Haman</hi> have had a greater affliction, then to Å¿ee <hi>Mordecai</hi> advanced, and himÅ¿elfe forced to bee an inÅ¿trument in his advancing? <hi>Videbunt quem transfixerunt, They Å¿hall Å¿ee him, whom they pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:16288:14"/> Å¿hall be one of the miÅ¿eries, and perhaps one of the greateÅ¿t in Hell it Å¿elfe.</p>
            <p>And now is <hi>David</hi> a King, and as a King, hath Honour and Plentie; <hi>Thou anoynteÅ¿t my head with oyle,</hi> This is his Honour; <hi>My cuppe runneth over,</hi> This is his Plentie: that where he Å¿aid before; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard; I Å¿hall not want:</hi> hee may as juÅ¿tly Å¿ay now; The Lord is my rewarder; I Å¿hall abound.</p>
            <p>But is it not that in the PerÅ¿on of <hi>David</hi> here, there is a Reference to ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe; Å¿eeing it is all verefied in him, that is Å¿poken here? Hee that hungred Å¿o long, till Sathan thought he could have eaten Å¿tones, hath now a Table prepared before him; a Table where the godly Å¿hall Å¿it, and eat with him in his Kingdome. Hee that had enemies inÅ¿ulting over him; hath now all his enemies made his foot-Å¿toole; Sinne and Death, Sathan and his members, lye proÅ¿trate under him: Hee that had his Head pricked with thornes, hath now his Head anoynted with Oyle: with the oyle of gladneÅ¿Å¿e above his fellowes. Hee that thirÅ¿ted, and could get but Vinegar to drinke, hath now Å¿uch plenty, that his cup runneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: All power is given him, both in Heaven and Earth. At leaÅ¿t in the perÅ¿on of <hi>David,</hi> there will be relation to all the godly: Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> that could not get Å¿o much as crummes from <hi>Dives</hi> his Table, Å¿hall have a Table him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe prepared before him: Now <hi>Dives</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16288:15"/> fared deliciouÅ¿ly every day, Å¿hall bee glad to Å¿tand waiting at <hi>Lazarus</hi> Table, for a drop of water: that the godly may well be content to be in penurie a-while, Å¿eeing they Å¿hall have a Table ere long prepared before them: They may well be content to let their Enemies bee maÅ¿ters awhile, Å¿eeing they Å¿hall have them ere long to be wayters upon them: They may well be content to hang downe their heads for awhile, Å¿eeing their heads ere long Å¿hall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with Oyle: They may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have hard meaÅ¿ure for a time, Å¿eeing the time will be Å¿hortly, that their Cup Å¿hall runne over. And now, O my Å¿oule, will not all this Å¿erve to comfort thee, in this vale of miÅ¿erie? Art thou Å¿o beÅ¿otted on things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, as to have no conÅ¿ideration, to make no valuation of things to come, and to come Å¿o Å¿hortly? Å¿o Å¿hortly all, that they are put in the PreÅ¿ent tenÅ¿e, as if they were come already?</p>
            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> cannot over-rule thee as a King, let him at leaÅ¿t perÅ¿wade thee as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; for now you Å¿hall have him a Prophet, and a Votarie, and this is his Prophecie; <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mercy, and goodneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hall follow mee, all the dayes of my life:</hi> and this is his Vow; <hi>I will dwell in the houÅ¿e of the Lord for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is <hi>Davids</hi> Prophecie like to bee true? will Mercie, and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e, follow him all the dayes of his life? O my Å¿oule, it was true in <hi>David,</hi> it Å¿hall be true in all the godly: for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16288:15"/> whom God loveth, he loveth to the end; and Mercie, and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hall follow them all the dayes of their life: Mercy, to commiÅ¿erate; and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e to relieve: Mercie to beare with infirmities, and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿upply wants: Mercie to be an aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant in AdverÅ¿itie, and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e to be a GoverneÅ¿Å¿e in ProÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Alas! O Lord, if thy Mercie Å¿hould not follow me, thy JuÅ¿tice would: if thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hould not follow mee, thy Vengeance would; and then one that were no Prophet, might eaÅ¿ily foretell the miÅ¿erable eÅ¿tate I Å¿hould be in: as now that Mercie and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e follow me; one that is no Prophet may eaÅ¿ily tell the happy condition I Å¿hall be in. Although this perhaps be not Å¿o much a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, as a Faith in <hi>David,</hi> at leaÅ¿t a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which all the godly may make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves by Faith, to be aÅ¿Å¿ured of the mercy and goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God; and not to follow them for a time, and then give over, but to follow them all the dayes of their life. But what? no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then all the dayes of their life, and then leave them? No my Å¿oule, but all the dayes of that life, that Å¿hall never leave them. O the comfortable doctrine of Faith! farre more comfortable then Heathen PhiloÅ¿ophie ever knew; for that went no further, then <hi>Ante obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nemo;</hi> as though no man could be happy till his death; where by this it appeares that men may bee happy while they live: for if a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16288:16"/> man be then happy, when the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of God follow him, as certainly a greater happineÅ¿Å¿e there cannot be: then Å¿eeing they Å¿urely follow the godly, all the dayes of their life; Å¿urely a godly man is happy while hee lives. But then the Å¿ureneÅ¿Å¿e is long of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not of the man: for it Å¿eemes he would goe farre enough from it, if Mercy did not follow him: but now that hee is followed by Mercy and GoodneÅ¿Å¿e, hee cannot goe Å¿o faÅ¿t from them, but they will overtake him, and make him happy. O mercifull God, Å¿o frame my heart, that I may not flye from thy Mercy, and put it to follow mee; at leaÅ¿t let it Å¿o fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, that it may overtake me: for then I Å¿hall have the happineÅ¿Å¿e to bee able to keepe my vow, that <hi>I will dwell in thy houÅ¿e for ever:</hi> but rather I Å¿hall have the favour, as an effect of thy Mercy, that <hi>I Å¿hall dwell in thy houÅ¿e for ever.</hi> For if this be a Vow, it is a Å¿trange one, where all the benefit is to him that makes the Vow, and none at all to whom it is made, for what is it to God, whither I dwell in his houÅ¿e or no? Å¿uch Vowers God may have enow. O my Å¿oule, to vow to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e, is to vow to be his Å¿ervant; and to bee his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is to Å¿erve him in holineÅ¿Å¿e, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, all the dayes of our life; and though this Å¿ervice be no benefit to God, as indeed no more is any thing I can doe, for my goodneÅ¿Å¿e extendeth not to him: yet the Vow to bee his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16288:16"/> Å¿ervant being well performed, will bee more acceptable to him, then if I Å¿hould vow as <hi>Jepthe</hi> did, to Å¿acrifice his onely Daughter.</p>
            <p>But wee need not Å¿tand to juÅ¿tifie <hi>Davids</hi> Vow: for it Å¿eemes not Å¿o much a Vow of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to God; as a favour of God to <hi>David,</hi> that when his mercy hath followed him all the dayes of his life, he will take him afterwards to live with himÅ¿elfe; and though his body for a time be caÅ¿t out of doores, yet his Å¿oule Å¿hall preÅ¿ently be received into his houÅ¿e, there to dwell with him and his Angels; not as a Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but as Å¿onne; Å¿eeing none but Å¿onnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the houÅ¿e for ever. Which in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of <hi>David,</hi> is no leÅ¿Å¿e the Portion, and may be as well the comfort of all the godly, and is but the expreÅ¿Å¿ing of that in a higher Å¿traine; which was Å¿aid at firÅ¿t in a lower Å¿tyle; <hi>The Lord is my Å¿hepheard: I Å¿hall not want.</hi>

Indeed Light, is not onely a directour, but a comforter: and nothing naturally Å¿trikes Å¿o much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as DarkneÅ¿Å¿e: for when wee are in the darke, not onely wee are apt to take into our fancies, all frightfull objects, but we know not how to take our Å¿teps, for feare of walls, and threÅ¿holds. It is every ones caÅ¿e, to have the Sunne for his light; but it is not every ones happineÅ¿Å¿e, to have God for his Light; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16288:20"/> alas, if I Å¿hould truÅ¿t to the Sunne for light, I Å¿hould be left in darkneÅ¿Å¿e, every day, at leaÅ¿t at night: but God is a Sunne that never Å¿ets: hee is Light himÅ¿elfe, hee is Light it Å¿elfe: and therefore it is good truÅ¿ting to God for Light: for Å¿o I Å¿hall be Å¿ure, neither day nor night, to be left in darkneÅ¿Å¿e. O thou great Creatour of Light; Thou Light of all creatures, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe to Å¿hine upon me, and to lighten my dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, that neither any Objects of terrour may make mee to tremble; nor any ThreÅ¿holds of errour may make mee to Å¿tumble, but that I may walke Å¿ecurely in the confidence of this; <hi>The Lord is my Light:</hi> for of what then, of whom now, Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But, is it enough that God bee my Light? what if I my Å¿elfe be blind? what good then will his Light doe mee? It is true; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> Å¿tayes not here; but, <hi>Deus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio mea; God is my Enlightening too.</hi> Hee is both my Light, and my Å¿ight: my Light, by which to Å¿ee; and my Å¿ight, with which to Å¿ee my Light, to make walls, and threÅ¿holds viÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and my Å¿ight, to make me able to avoide them. If it were not for Light, I Å¿hould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the darke; if it were not for Å¿ight, I Å¿hould bee darke my Å¿elfe: No illumination without both: and never both, but onely from God. There is one indeed, who hath gotten him a Name, to be called <hi>Lucifer;</hi> as though it were hee, that brought us Light: when God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16288:20"/> knowes but for him, we Å¿hould have had no darkneÅ¿Å¿e: yet he pretends to both; both to Light, and to enlightning: but alas, his light is but impoÅ¿ture; his enlightning, but illuÅ¿ion: for as he can transforme himÅ¿elfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light; Å¿o he can transforme the light it Å¿elfe, and make it Å¿eeme light, when it is indeed darke: and therefore his light can never make Walls and ThreÅ¿holds to be truly viÅ¿ible: and as little can his enlightening, make us able to avoide them. For this was tryed in our firÅ¿t Parents, who upon his Enlightening, had their eyes opened indeed, but opened to Å¿ee Good and Evill; not to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h good from evill, and therefore could not enable them, cannot us, to avoid the evill. But as they, that follow his light, doe Å¿tumble and fall at the ThreÅ¿hold of errour; Å¿o they that are led by his enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, doe run their heads againÅ¿t the Walls of impietie; No avoiding of Walls and Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿holds; No Å¿hunning the Å¿nares of Sathan, the illuÅ¿ions of this <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but onely by Å¿aying, if truly Å¿aying; <hi>Deus illuminatio mea,</hi> God is my enlightening; and then we may Å¿afely inferre, of what; of whom Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>David</hi> might well Å¿ay; <hi>Deus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio mea; God is my Enlightening:</hi> Seeing God had enlightened him, not onely to Å¿ee, but to be a Seer, which is a Prophet: but what is this to us, who are farre from any Å¿uch enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to Å¿ee as Prophets? O my Å¿oule, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16288:21"/> for us; that ChriÅ¿t is the great Seer, in whoÅ¿e Light, wee Å¿hall Å¿ee light: and though <hi>David</hi> were of the Jewes, and wee bee of the Gentiles; yet as ChriÅ¿t was the glory of his people IÅ¿rael: Å¿o he is a Light, to lighten the Gentiles: and therefore <hi>Deus illuminatio mea, God is my enlightening;</hi> as fit for us to Å¿ay, as it was for <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth Gods enlightening Å¿erve onely for a Å¿afeguard againÅ¿t Walls and ThreÅ¿holds? Alas! the light of the Sunne, and the enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of Nature would Å¿erve to doe this: and what need we then to Å¿eeke any other? O my Å¿oule, there are Å¿pirituall Walls, and Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿holds, which no Sunne can make us Å¿ee, which Nature her Å¿elfe is not able to Å¿ee; onely Gods enlightening, hath the influence to doe it. There is a Wall of Å¿inne, the Partition Wall betweene God and us: the Wall that barres us from having acceÅ¿Å¿e to God: and this Wall, the naturall man Å¿ees not, neither can Å¿ee: Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination onely makes it viÅ¿ible. There is a ThreÅ¿hold of pride in the heart of man; a Å¿welling of Å¿elfe-love, that lyes in the way wee are to paÅ¿Å¿e, and is a cauÅ¿e of Å¿tumbling if not avoyded: and this ThreÅ¿hold the naturall man Å¿ees not, neither can Å¿ee; onely Gods illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination makes able to Å¿ee it. And many other Walls and ThreÅ¿holds there are, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Illumination can never be Å¿eene; and not Å¿eene, can never be avoided; and not avoided,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16288:21"/> are cauÅ¿e of falling into endleÅ¿Å¿e perdition. And as Illumination makes us to Å¿ee theÅ¿e lights of Terrour, Å¿o it makes us to Å¿ee alÅ¿o Å¿ights of Comfort; It makes us Å¿ee Death lye dead before us, and Å¿wallowed up in Victory; It makes us Å¿ee the powers of Hell aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed, as not able to endure the luÅ¿tre of this Light: It makes us Å¿ee the doores of Heaven open, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which by vertue of this Light wee have meanes to enter: It makes us Å¿ee him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ible, God himÅ¿elfe that is our enlightening, in whoÅ¿e PreÅ¿ence, is the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of Joy for evermore; and of whom then, of what now Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e indeed bee comfortable Å¿ights, but what comfort for me to Å¿ee them, if I bee not Å¿ure I Å¿hall enjoy them? and how can I be any more Å¿ure to enjoy them, then the Angells that fell? For they had Illumination, in a greater meaÅ¿ure then I can hope to have it; and yet for all their Illumination, they Å¿tumbled at the ThreÅ¿hold of Pride: and ranne their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Wall of Å¿inne, and utterly loÅ¿t; Alas have loÅ¿t for ever, all benefit, of all theÅ¿e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Å¿ights. All this is true, and therefore <hi>David</hi> Å¿tayes not here neither; but <hi>Deus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio mea, &amp; Å¿alus mea; God is my enlightening, and my Å¿alvation too,</hi> and this hee was not to the Angels that fell: hee left them at Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, never conducted them to Å¿alvation; for if hee had done this, their Illumination had

                  </expan>,</hi> but Å¿hould preÅ¿ently follow it with <hi>Deteriora Å¿equor:</hi> but when he is my Å¿alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; this makes me breake off at <hi>Deteriora Å¿equor:</hi> and where God was heard to Å¿ay; <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio tua ex te O IÅ¿rael,</hi> Thy deÅ¿truction is from thy Å¿elfe, O IÅ¿rael: Now to heare him Å¿ay, <hi>Ego autem Å¿alus tua,</hi> but I am thy Å¿alvation. If my illumination reflected upon my Å¿elfe, to make me Å¿eeme bright in my owne eyes, as though I had Å¿omething which I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then indeed I Å¿hould bee in the caÅ¿e of the Angels that fell; for Å¿o did they: but now that my illumination reflects upon God: and makes me Å¿ee all goodneÅ¿Å¿e to be originally in him, none in my Å¿elfe, but what he is pleaÅ¿ed to impart, or impute unto me; Now Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation becomes a Å¿tep to Å¿alvation, and as they are free indeed whom the Spirit frees; Å¿o they are Å¿afe indeed, whom God Å¿aves; and of what then, of whom now, Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But though God be my Å¿alvation: yet this perhaps may be onely in the life to come, and if it be no more but Å¿o, I may doe ill enough in this preÅ¿ent life, for all his Å¿alvation in the next; and have I not cauÅ¿e then to bee afraid? To free thee therefore of this Å¿cruple; <hi>David</hi> Å¿tayes not here neither; but, <hi>God is my Å¿alvation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16288:22"/> and the Å¿trength of my life too;</hi> Not onely of my life to come, which will be Å¿trong of it Å¿elfe, but of my preÅ¿ent life, which hath no Å¿trength but in him. Or rather Å¿eeing godlineÅ¿Å¿e hath the promiÅ¿e of both lifes, both of this life, and the life to come, the firÅ¿t Å¿hall be firÅ¿t Å¿erved; and then if God be the Å¿trength of my preÅ¿ent life, there Å¿hall be in it no preÅ¿ent weakneÅ¿Å¿e: and if no weakneÅ¿Å¿e, there need bee no feare; and of what then; of whom now, Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But though Gods Å¿trength be Å¿ufficient to defend me, if I had no enemies: Or if I were to fight but a Å¿ingle combat, yet can it be Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preÅ¿erve me, when an Army of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aÅ¿Å¿aults me at once? and can I chooÅ¿e but feare, when I know my Å¿elfe unable to reÅ¿iÅ¿t? O my Å¿oule, take heed thou be not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoÅ¿e, to whom it was Å¿aid; <hi>What feare yee, O yee of little faith?</hi> For what can an Army doe, againÅ¿t the arme of God? What can all Might do, againÅ¿t him that is Almightie? Have my enemies any Å¿trength, but what they have from God? And can they have any Å¿trength from him, againÅ¿t me, when hee employes his Å¿trength againÅ¿t them for me? No my Å¿oule; <hi>though an hoÅ¿t encampe againÅ¿t mee; though warre bee made upon mee;</hi> yet as long as God is the Å¿trength of my life, it is neither their multitude, nor their malice that can hurt mee; but rather their very malice is the meanes, their multitude
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16288:23"/> cannot hurt me, for Malice hinders Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes them, they cannot Å¿ee their way; that when they came upon mee, and thought they had me Å¿ure enough; even then I was Å¿ure enough from their having: For hee that is the Å¿trength of my life, had layd a block in their way, which for want of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they Å¿aw not, at which they Å¿tumbled, and fell.</p>
            <p>But yet, it is a grievous thing to have Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls for ones enemies, and Å¿uch my enemies Å¿eeme to be: They Å¿eeke not more to deÅ¿troy mee, then devoure mee: They came upon mee to eat up my fleÅ¿h, as if I had beene their Å¿ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; It is not enough they could kill mee, but they could find in their hearts to eat me: They are not Å¿atisfied with procuring my death, if they bee not themÅ¿elves actours in it: It is not enough for them to have my bloud, unleÅ¿Å¿e their owne hands be imbrued in it: Indeed there is no Å¿uch daintie diÅ¿h to a malicious Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, as the fleÅ¿h of an enemy; it goes downe without chewing, and they Å¿wallow it up whole like Cormorants. But though Malice have a ravenous Å¿tomack, yet Å¿he hath but Å¿low diÅ¿geÅ¿tion; though her teeth be Å¿harpe, yet her feet are lame, at leaÅ¿t apt to Å¿tumble, and this made well for <hi>David,</hi> for when his enemies came upon him, to eate up his fleÅ¿h, becauÅ¿e they came upon the feet of malice, they Å¿tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell. A man may Å¿tumble, and yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16288:23"/> not fall, but to Å¿tumble, and fall withall, is the proper Å¿tumbling of the wicked, and eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the maliciouÅ¿ly wicked: and Å¿uch, it Å¿eemes was the Å¿tumbling of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, becauÅ¿e his enemies were Å¿uch; and Å¿uch I doubt not Å¿hall bee the Å¿tumbling of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauÅ¿e mine are Å¿uch: and of what then, of whom now, Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <p>But to the end I may have Å¿ome exerciÅ¿e for my illumination, that it Å¿tand not idle; and may have Å¿ome teÅ¿timonie for my Å¿alvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it grow not doubtfull; <hi>There is one <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>4</label> thing I have deÅ¿ired of the Lord, and that I will Å¿eeke after; that I may dwell in the houÅ¿e of the Lord, all the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lord: and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> This beholding of Gods beauty, will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exerciÅ¿e for my Illumination; and this enquiring in Gods holy Temple, will give me aÅ¿Å¿urance of my Å¿alvation.</p>
            <p>It were very hard, if <hi>David</hi> making but one requeÅ¿t to God, that God Å¿hould deny him? for hath he not bidden us to aske, and wee Å¿hould have? and could <hi>David</hi> aske leÅ¿Å¿e, then to aske but one thing? No my Å¿oule: God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it not to <hi>David,</hi> nor will deny it to thee, nor to any other that Å¿hall aske it in Faith: and Å¿pecially if hee aske it to Å¿o good an end as <hi>David</hi> doth here; to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple.</p>
            <p>But Å¿eeing <hi>David</hi> would make but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16288:24"/> to God, why would he not make a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? for alas, what a poore requeÅ¿t is this, to deÅ¿ire to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e? and what to doe? but onely to Å¿ee? and to Å¿ee what? but onely a Beautie, a fading thing, at moÅ¿t but to enquire; and what is enquiring? but onely to heare newes; a vaine fancie; and what cauÅ¿e in any of theÅ¿e why <hi>David</hi> Å¿hould make it his requeÅ¿t to God? But marke, O my Å¿oule, what goes with it; Take altogether; <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple:</hi> And now tell mee, if there be, tell me if there can be any greater requeÅ¿t to be made? any greater cauÅ¿e to be earneÅ¿t about it? For though worldly beauty be a fading thing, yet the Beauty of the Lord Å¿hall continue, when the world it Å¿elfe Å¿hall fade away; and though enquiring after newes be a vaine fancie, yet to enquire in Gods Temple, is the way to learne, there is no new thing under the Sunne; and there it was that <hi>Solomon</hi> learned, that all is vanitie. Indeed this one thing that <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires, is in effect, that <hi>Unum neceÅ¿Å¿arium</hi> that ChriÅ¿t Å¿peakes of in the GoÅ¿pell; which <hi>Mary</hi> made choyce of there, as <hi>David</hi> doth here; and I may Å¿ay, it is that pretious Jewell, which the rich Merchant Å¿old all he had to buy, and had his bargaine commended by ChriÅ¿t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe. O how happy were wee, if we could bound our deÅ¿ires within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of things neceÅ¿Å¿erie: for all our miÅ¿erie growes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16288:24"/> from this, that our deÅ¿ires have no certaine dwelling, but wander and range about from one object to another, like vagabonds from place to place; and no helpe there will be for it, till our deÅ¿ire arrive at that which is the beÅ¿t: for as long as there is any better to be had, the DeÅ¿ire will never leave deÅ¿iring; and where is that beÅ¿t to be had, but in him onely, that is onely good: in him indeed that is the onely good: and Å¿eeing there can be no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e till the DeÅ¿ire be Å¿ettled; and the DeÅ¿ire will never be Å¿ettled, till wee come at God; therefore no meanes Å¿o likely to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e; for there wee are Å¿ure we Å¿hall be with him; and once with him, never have deÅ¿ire to any thing beÅ¿ides him.</p>
            <p>There are other houÅ¿es, which in worldly conÅ¿iderations, and to worldly mindes, may Å¿eeme as convenient, and perhaps be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to dwell in, then this houÅ¿e of God: but that which makes me Å¿o deÅ¿irous to dwell here, rather then any where elÅ¿e, is partly for the proÅ¿pect, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord; and partly for inÅ¿truction, that I may enquire in his holy Temple. For there is not Å¿uch a ProÅ¿pect againe in the world as this; Not on the Mount, where ChriÅ¿t was Å¿hewed all the Kingdomes of the earth, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them: Nor Å¿uch another place for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction as here; Not all the Schooles of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16288:25"/> PhiloÅ¿ophers; Not all the Oracles of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, in any degree to be compared with it.</p>
            <p>And what then is this beauty of God, which <hi>David</hi> is Å¿o deÅ¿irous to behold? what this houÅ¿e of God, in which he deÅ¿ires to dwell? There is a beauty of God in his creatures, moÅ¿t glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeed, and moÅ¿t worthy of beholding: but yet this needs no dwelling in Gods houÅ¿e to Å¿ee it; wee may Å¿ee it as well, dwelling any where elÅ¿e; but there is a beauty of God in himÅ¿elfe, a beauty which if once we Å¿ee, wee Å¿hall never be willing to take our eyes off; a beauty which the more wee Å¿ee, the more we Å¿hall Å¿ee cauÅ¿e to deÅ¿ire to Å¿ee it; a Beauty, which without Å¿peciall illumination, neither the eyes of men are able to behold; nor the tongues of Angels to expreÅ¿Å¿e; and this Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no where to be Å¿eene, but in Gods houÅ¿e; and not there neither, but by dwelling in it: It is not for every one that comes in as a Å¿tranger, to Å¿ee this Beauty, they muÅ¿t be dwellers in it; continuall, and conÅ¿tant frequenters of it, or they are never like to be admitted to behold it. There is indeed, in all the creatures of God, in Å¿ome more eminently, a certaine tincture of this Beauty, and is perhaps that which deceives us in the eÅ¿timating of our happineÅ¿Å¿e; becauÅ¿e wee take tincture for Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and fixe our Å¿elves upon that which is made but onely for a paÅ¿Å¿age. For tinctures though they pleaÅ¿e for a time, yet they Å¿oone weare out and decay:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16288:25"/> no Å¿olidneÅ¿Å¿e, nor durableneÅ¿Å¿e, but in the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance it Å¿elfe, and no Å¿ubÅ¿tance of beauty, but onely in God: and therefore the trueÅ¿t happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, indeed all true happineÅ¿Å¿e, in onely the beholding of this Beauty. And if any man doubt of this, becauÅ¿e Å¿eeing, is but the Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of one Å¿enÅ¿e; and happineÅ¿Å¿e gives Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at leaÅ¿t to all the Å¿enÅ¿es: Let him then heare, what <hi>David</hi> in another place Å¿ayes; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete &amp; guÅ¿tate, quam Å¿uavis eÅ¿t Dominus: See, and taÅ¿te, how Å¿weet the Lord is:</hi> For in this See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not onely the TaÅ¿ting, but all the Å¿enÅ¿es are united, at leaÅ¿t the pleaÅ¿ures of all the Å¿enÅ¿es are compriÅ¿ed: and the rather, if wee conÅ¿ider that Beholding hath a preheminence above Seeing: for where Å¿eeing may bee in <hi>TranÅ¿itu</hi> onely; Beholding implyes a permanencie, and a fixing our eyes upon it; and Å¿uch is the See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is the EÅ¿Å¿entiall Å¿enÅ¿e of happineÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>And what then is this houÅ¿e of God, in which <hi>David</hi> deÅ¿ires to dwell? hath God any other houÅ¿e then Heaven? and would <hi>David</hi> dwell in Heaven, whilÅ¿t hee is dwelling upon Earth? will nothing Å¿erve his turne, but to aske God for impoÅ¿Å¿ibilities? Indeed Heaven is Gods Throne, but Heaven and Earth both, are full of the MajeÅ¿tie of his glory: and therefore God hath a HouÅ¿e on earth too; a HouÅ¿e dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the honour of his Name; and <hi>David</hi> juÅ¿tly makes his Prayer for this HouÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e indeed it is the houÅ¿e of Prayer, and no Rent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16288:26"/> payd for dwelling in it, but onely Prayer: O then make me able, O God, to pay thee this Rent, and I Å¿hall never doubt of continuing thy tenant in this HouÅ¿e, to behold thy Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to inquire in thy holy Temple.</p>
            <p>But why Å¿hould <hi>David</hi> make it a Å¿uite to God, to dwell in his HouÅ¿e, Å¿eeing God leaves the doores open, that every one may come and dwell in it that will? O my Å¿oule, it is not Å¿imply to dwell in it, but Å¿o to dwell in it, that he may Å¿ee Gods beauty; and this cannot bee Å¿eene without illumination; and no illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Gods donation. For indeed this dwelling, is a Å¿pirituall living, a donative one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods gift: and juÅ¿tly therefore <hi>David</hi> makes it his Å¿uite, to have his Induction, but an Induction onely while wee live here; no perfect poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion till another life: but hee that Å¿eekes not his induction here; muÅ¿t never looke for poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to behold the beauty of God, is one great benefit of dwelling in Gods houÅ¿e; Å¿o it is another no leÅ¿Å¿e to inquire in his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as that beholding, gives a Å¿atisfaction to our eyes; Å¿o this inquirie to our mindes. When <hi>David</hi> Å¿aw the proÅ¿peritie of the wicked; hee was Å¿o amazed, that hee knew not what to make of it, till he entred into Gods holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and inquired: and there he preÅ¿ently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what Gods meaning is in it, and why hee Å¿uffers it to be Å¿o. What knowledge Å¿o neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16288:26"/> as the knowledge of Å¿inne? yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth hee had not knowne what Å¿inne is, but for the Law: and where is the Law to bee learned, but enquiring in Gods holy Temple? and indeed if there bee any Å¿cruple of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if any doubtfulneÅ¿Å¿e of mind, if any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of queÅ¿tion concerning either God or our Å¿elves; either the life preÅ¿ent, or the life to come, by enquiring in Gods holy Temple, it is preÅ¿ently cleered, and reÅ¿olved: for there are the Oracles kept, which Å¿erve to inÅ¿truct, to teach, to reprove, that the man of God may be perfect in every good worke.</p>
            <p>And amongÅ¿t all the great myÅ¿teries which are learned by enquiring in Gods holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this is one of Å¿peciall comfort to me, that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>5</label> 
               <hi>when I am in trouble,</hi> if his houÅ¿e that I dwell in, be not Å¿ufficient to defend me; <hi>he will hide me in his owne Pavillion: in the Å¿ecret of his Tabernacle will hee hide mee; hee will Å¿et mee upon a rock:</hi> that one way or other, he will bee Å¿ure; and I may be Å¿ure, he will Å¿et mee in Å¿afetie,</p>
            <p>But how can God hide me in his Pavillion, which lyes open to all men; and where every man may enter, and find me? He will then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faile, hide me in the Å¿ecret of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; which is Å¿hut againÅ¿t all men, and where none enters but himÅ¿elfe. But yet his Tabernacle may be burnt with fire; may bee blowne up with powder; blowne downe with winde: and what Å¿afetie then, in the Å¿ecret
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16288:27"/> of his Tabernacle? Hee will then, if that faile, Å¿et me upon a Rocke, and a Rocke is Å¿ubject to none of theÅ¿e, that Å¿o at leaÅ¿t, neither fire, nor Å¿word, nor tempeÅ¿t of wind, may prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t me. Or is it, that being once admitted to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e; I Å¿hall have, not onely the protection of a Å¿ervant; for his <hi>Tegere,</hi> is <hi>Protegere;</hi> but the advancement alÅ¿o of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite to be Å¿et upon a Rocke: for this, as it is a Å¿afetie, is no leÅ¿Å¿e an honour. Or is it, that leÅ¿t mine enemies Å¿hould thinke it were done for feare of them, that he hydes me; he will Å¿et me upon a Rocke, as it were in defyance: and though Å¿ome may be Å¿o bold to enter the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Tabernacle; yet none will bee Å¿o deÅ¿perate, to venture upon a Rock, againÅ¿t which, all they can doe, is but to daÅ¿h them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in peeces, and to haÅ¿ten their owne ruine.</p>
            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, how canÅ¿t thou doubt of thy being in Å¿afetie, having the three great fortreÅ¿Å¿es of God for thy defence: his generall providence, which is his Pavillion: then, his Å¿peciall Mercie, which is the Å¿ecret of his Tabernacle: then, the Mediation of ChriÅ¿t, who is the Rocke; upon which, when thou art Å¿et, neither the raging of the Sea, nor the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tering of the wind, need to affright thee; for though they roare againÅ¿t thee, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt thee; and of whom then, of what now Å¿hould I be afraid?</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:16288:27"/>
            <p>For being Å¿et upon this Rock; <hi>My head Å¿hall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>6</label> bee lifted up above mine enemies round about mee:</hi> Though my feet may be in the water, yet my head Å¿hall be above water; I Å¿hall be in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though perhaps in Å¿ome trouble; and in no trouble neither, but Å¿uch as while my head is lifted up, I may freely laugh at, and deÅ¿piÅ¿e; and the rather, for that though my enemies be Å¿o many, as to be round about me; yet they are Å¿o meane, as to be all below mee; not meane in themÅ¿elves, but meane through him, that hath lifted up my head above them. If mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were but low, it were no great matter to be higher then they: but to have my head lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up above them, who carry their heads Å¿o high, as to thinke none their equalls; this muÅ¿t needs be, as well to me a cauÅ¿e of joy; as in thee, O God, an effect of power. In thy lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up my head, I regard not Å¿o much the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the relation to my enemies; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lifted up little, or much, it is all one to mee, Å¿o long as it bee above my enemies, their pitch is my proportion: for the marke of my ayme, is not Å¿uperiority, but Å¿ecuritie; not to Å¿hine in other mens eyes, but not to have mine owne put out.</p>
            <p>There may be many cauÅ¿es of joy to a man in trouble, but none Å¿o great as this, to have his head lifted up above his enemies: for though to take revenge of an enemy, bee the delight onely of a cruell nature; yet to be able to take
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16288:28"/> revenge, is a joy to the mildeÅ¿t nature, but yet a joy that muÅ¿t bee made a Å¿acrifice, not to grow inÅ¿olent, and proud upon it; but as to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive the power with humilitie, Å¿o to uÅ¿e it with mildneÅ¿Å¿e, and moÅ¿t of all, to aÅ¿cribe the glory, to whom it belongs.</p>
            <p>There was a time, O God, when thou didÅ¿t lift up mine enemies heads above me; and even then I offered thee a Å¿acrifice too; but it was a Å¿orrowfull Å¿acrifice, a Å¿acrifice of Å¿orrow; but when thou Å¿halt lift up my head above mine enemies, I will then offer thee a joyfull Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a Å¿acrifice of joy: and it Å¿hall not bee a Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent joy, as though I Å¿ought to Å¿mother it, by which no glory would come unto thee; but it Å¿hall be a Å¿inging joy, and the Å¿ong Å¿hall bee of thy praiÅ¿es, as Å¿hewing me to joy more, in thy lifting me up; then in my being lift up; more for thy glory, then for my owne advancement, but Å¿ing I Å¿hall for both; I Å¿hall Å¿ing, to expreÅ¿Å¿e my joy, and I Å¿hall Å¿ing to extoll thy PraiÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>But why is <hi>David</hi> Å¿o Å¿uddenly turned from Å¿inging to crying, that hee Å¿hould fall Å¿o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently to Å¿ay; <hi>Heare mee, O Lord, when I cry with my voyce?</hi> Is it, that hee findes God, not well pleaÅ¿ed with his Å¿inging; and therefore meanes to try, what hee can doe with crying? Or is it, that he thinkes himÅ¿elfe better at expreÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿orrow then joy, and therefore hopes his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be heard, though his Å¿inging bee not? Or is it indeed, that Å¿inging, and crying both,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16288:28"/> are little enough to make a Å¿acrifice to God? Alas! they are both of them too little, to make an acceptable Å¿acrifice, without Gods mercy: and therefore <hi>David</hi> truÅ¿ts not to them alone, but is glad to joyne Gods mercy with them; <hi>Have mercy alÅ¿o upon mee, O God, and anÅ¿wer mee.</hi> It is a great mercy in God to heare us, but a greater mercy to anÅ¿wer us; and therefore to require his anÅ¿wer, requires a more Å¿peciall invocation of his mercy; and the rather, in hope to have a mercifull anÅ¿wer: for alas, if he Å¿hould anÅ¿wer, and not in mercy, Å¿uch an anÅ¿wer would be worÅ¿e then Å¿ilence.</p>
            <p>But how can I doubt of Gods anÅ¿wering me, when I Å¿peake to him; who have my Å¿elfe anÅ¿wered him, when hee Å¿pake to mee? For when thou Å¿aydÅ¿t; <hi>Seeke yee my face; my heart <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>8</label> Å¿aid unto thee; Thy face Lord, I will Å¿eeke:</hi> and for my heart to Å¿ay it, is more then for my voyce to cry it: for no crying of the voyce, makes Å¿o loude a Å¿ound in the eares of God; as the Å¿aying of the heart; that to uÅ¿e the termes properly, I might rather Å¿ay; I cry it with my heart, and but Å¿ay it with my voyce.</p>
            <p>But is this all the anÅ¿wer I Å¿hall have from God, that I Å¿hould Å¿eeke his face? Alas! O Lord, thy great Favourite <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> could never obtaine more then to Å¿ee thy Back-parts, and how then can I hope to Å¿ee thy face? and if I cannot hope to Å¿ee it, why wouldÅ¿t thou have me Å¿pend time to Å¿eeke it? But is it not all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16288:29"/> one, in the phraÅ¿e of the Law, to Å¿eeke Gods face; as in the phraÅ¿e of the GoÅ¿pell, to Å¿eeke Gods kingdome? and therefore as God Å¿aith here; <hi>Å¿eeke yee my face:</hi> Å¿o ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith there; <hi>Å¿eeke Gods kingdome:</hi> at leaÅ¿t if they be not both one; they are both Å¿ought one way; both Å¿ought by following Gods Commandements, for his Commandements, if wee follow them well, will both bring us to his kingdome, and to Å¿ee his face.</p>
            <p>Or is it not perhaps in a plaine literall Å¿ence, that to Å¿eeke Gods face, is in our Prayers, and Meditations, to Å¿ettle, and fixe the eyes of our mindes wholly upon God; and as it were, to looke him in the face: wherein, oh what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite oddes there is betweene the Angels and us, for magnifying of God: for they behold his Face, and can Å¿ee it viÅ¿ibly, where all that we can doe towards it, is onely by the Å¿trength of imagination, which God knowes is but weake; very weake in us, weake in it Å¿elfe, and weaker for want of intention; but if we could Å¿ee his Face as the Angels doe; O my Å¿oule, we Å¿hould Å¿ee in it, not onely infinite cauÅ¿es for magnifying his Name; but infinite Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e for pleaÅ¿ing our owne Å¿enÅ¿es. For if the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a carnall face, be Å¿o admirable, Å¿o plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, as that no earthly thing may bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it; what extaÅ¿ie of admiration! what tranÅ¿cendencie of pleaÅ¿ure muÅ¿t needes be in the beautie of a Å¿pirituall Face! and Å¿pecially
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16288:29"/> that face, in which the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of all Beauty reÅ¿ideth bodily! And have I not cauÅ¿e then to Å¿eeke this Face? O mercifull God, grant me Å¿o to Å¿eeke it, that I may find it: for though this be not the place for finding it, yet this is the place for Å¿eeking it: and hee that Å¿eekes it not here; he that Å¿eekes it not now, is never like to find it in another place, never like to find it hereafter.</p>
            <p>But why am I Å¿o haÅ¿tie, to promiÅ¿e God to Å¿eeke his Face, as though it were in my owne power to Å¿eeke it at my pleaÅ¿ure? Alas! how can I chooÅ¿e but promiÅ¿e it, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; and how can I thinke, when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, but that hee will enable me; at leaÅ¿t, not hinder me to performe it? and yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e not performance, but Will: and Will I Å¿uppoÅ¿e I may Å¿afely promiÅ¿e, Å¿eeing Will is preÅ¿ent with me, and can never be abÅ¿ent from mee.</p>
            <p>But when I Å¿eeke thy face, vouchÅ¿afe, O <label type="milestone">

Alas! O Lord, to bid me Å¿eeke it, and then goe preÅ¿ently and hide it from me; what were this but to mock me, as the Jewes mocked ChriÅ¿t; blindfold him, and Å¿trike him; and then bid him tell, who Å¿trooke him? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how Å¿hould I Å¿eeke it, if I have not light to Å¿eeke it by? and what light to Å¿eeke it by?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16288:30"/> and what light to Å¿eeke it by, but the light of thy Countenance? and what light of thy Countenance, if thou hide away thy face? To bid me to Å¿eeke thy Face, and then to hide thy Face from me, were a kind of deriÅ¿ion; and I hope, O God, thou wilt not uÅ¿e me Å¿o unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Å¿et me about a worke Å¿carce poÅ¿Å¿ible to bee done, and then take from mee all poÅ¿Å¿ible meanes of doing it? Alas! O Lord, all the encouragement I have to Å¿eeke it, is the hope I have thou wilt not hide it: O therefore, <hi>Hide not thy face from mee, O God:</hi> for if thou hide thy Face from me, what can I thinke, but that thou art angry? and if indeed thou be angry, yet uÅ¿e me at leaÅ¿t as a Å¿ervant; <hi>Put mee not away in thine anger:</hi> for though I have committed many heynous faults againÅ¿t thee, yet may I not repent, and amend them all, if thou but pleaÅ¿e, not to bee Å¿o haÅ¿tie with mee? what though my Å¿innes have made thee angry, wilt thou therefore preÅ¿ently turne me away? will no leÅ¿Å¿e puniÅ¿hment, Å¿erve to appeaÅ¿e thy diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿ure, but to turne me preÅ¿ently out of Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? mayÅ¿t thou not in Å¿o doing, doe that in anger, which thou wilt have cauÅ¿e perhaps to be Å¿orry for afterwards? wilt thou not leave thy Å¿elfe unprovided of Å¿ervants to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? For where are any Å¿uch Å¿ervants to be found, that Å¿ome time or other, will not give thee cauÅ¿e to bee angry?

Hath not Mercie the higheÅ¿t Å¿eat in thine Arke; and Å¿hall anger be able to put her from her Å¿eate? Thou haÅ¿t beene my helper heretofore, and why didÅ¿t thou helpe me, but becauÅ¿e I needed thy aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance? and may I not with thy aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance now returne from my evill way; if thou be pleaÅ¿ed not to be Å¿o haÅ¿tie to turne me away?

CanÅ¿t thou Å¿o Å¿oone change from Mercy to Anger; and from Anger againe to Mercie; that we Å¿hould never know in what temper to find thee? No my Å¿oule, farre be it from thee to have Å¿uch thoughts: but the truth is, Gods wayes are not diÅ¿cerned, not diÅ¿cernable by us, they are paÅ¿t our finding out: We know nothing at any time, what it is he doth; leÅ¿Å¿e, why; and leaÅ¿t of all, how hee

            <p>But what ingredient of comfort, is a hope to Å¿ee? for doe I not Å¿ee now, as well as I am like to doe hereafter? were not our firÅ¿t Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents eyes opened in ParadiÅ¿e; and can wee hope to Å¿ee better, then they Å¿aw there? and doe not our eyes Å¿tand as open as theirs Å¿till? O my Å¿oule, the opening of their eyes then,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16288:33"/> hath made us Å¿ee the worÅ¿e ever Å¿ince: wee Å¿ee now, but as in a GlaÅ¿Å¿e, rather appearances of things, then things themÅ¿elves; we Å¿ee nothing now but colours, and colours are deceitfull, and no truÅ¿ting to them: the light I hope for, is to Å¿ee, as I am Å¿eene; a Å¿ight not Å¿ubject to either dimneÅ¿Å¿e, or dazeling: a Å¿ight that diÅ¿cerneth not onely colours, but Å¿ubÅ¿tances; and is not the hope of Å¿uch a Å¿ight, a comfortable Ingredient to keepe from fainting?</p>
            <p>But yet what good is it, to Å¿ee goodneÅ¿Å¿e? for we Å¿ee many good things, which yet wee are never the better for Å¿eeing: But is it not true here, <hi>Videte &amp; guÅ¿tate?</hi> for Å¿uch our Å¿eeing Å¿hall be: <hi>Vidchimus &amp; guÅ¿tavimus;</hi> our Å¿eeing Å¿hall be a taÅ¿ting; our taÅ¿ting, an enjoying; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying is not properly of any thing, but in which there is joy; and where there is joy, muÅ¿t there not needs be comfort?</p>
            <p>But yet what more goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God can wee hope to Å¿ee hereafter, then now? for can there bee a greater goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God to bee Å¿eene then this, that hee makes the Sunne to Å¿hine, the raine to fall, upon both juÅ¿t and unjuÅ¿t? Wee Å¿ee indeed now a great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of God: but wee Å¿ee it mingled with much badneÅ¿Å¿e of men; and may I not Å¿ay with Å¿ome badneÅ¿Å¿e of his too? for is there any evill in the Citie, and God hath not done it? but the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God which I hope to Å¿ee, is a goodneÅ¿Å¿e like to garbled Å¿pice,

The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of God which we Å¿ee now, is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e in effects; but there is a goodneÅ¿Å¿e in God, which is as the cauÅ¿e: Not as having goodneÅ¿Å¿e, but as being goodneÅ¿Å¿e: Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as imparting it Å¿elfe to us, but as communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it Å¿elfe with us; and this goodneÅ¿Å¿e wee Å¿hall then Å¿ee, though now we cannot. Have PhiloÅ¿ophers conceived, that if vertue could be Å¿eene with the eyes, <hi>Mirabiles excitaret amores Å¿ui;</hi> It would Å¿tirre up in us a wonderfull love; and will not the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God, when Å¿eene with our eyes, Å¿tirre up in our hearts, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull joy? and is not the hope of Å¿uch a joy a Å¿trong Cordiall to keepe from fainting?</p>
            <p>But why in the land of the living? for is not the world in which wee now live, the land of the living?

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what Land of the living is this, in which there are more dead then living; more under ground, then are above it: where the earth is fuller of graves then houÅ¿es; where life lyes trembling under the hand of Death, and where Death hath power to tyrannize over
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16288:34"/> life? No my Å¿oule, there onely is the Land of the living, where there are none but the living; where there is a Church not Militant, but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, a Church indeed, but no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, becauÅ¿e none dead, nor none that can dye: where life is not paÅ¿Å¿ive; nor Death active: where Life Å¿its crowned; and where Death is Å¿wallowed up in victorie. And now make up a Compound of theÅ¿e Ingredients: Take firÅ¿t, a Hope of Å¿eeing, which is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: then the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God, not a qualitie, but a Å¿ubÅ¿tance: then the Land of the living, where there is no dying: and now Å¿ay, if Å¿uch a Cordial muÅ¿t not needs be Å¿trong, of neceÅ¿Å¿itie be effectuall, to keepe from fainting?

O my Å¿oule, the Å¿howres of Gods bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings are Å¿o continually poured downe upon us, that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible we Å¿hould ever get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with God in Allelujahs. Although
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16288:37"/> therefore he begin with an Allelujah, yet it is becauÅ¿e God hath prevented him in his HoÅ¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: Hee will extoll God, but it is becauÅ¿e God hath lifted him up: Gods praiÅ¿e indeed is put in the PreÅ¿ent TenÅ¿e, but it is becauÅ¿e his benefit is in the Preterperfect TenÅ¿e: <hi>I will extoll thee, O God; for thou haÅ¿t lifted mee up, and haÅ¿t not made my foes to rejoyce over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> will extoll God; how will he doe it? for to doe it unworthily, it were better to be left undone, and who is able to extoll God worthily? Hee will therefore perhaps call all the creatures of God to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him, and Å¿ay; <hi>PraiÅ¿e the Lord, all yee his Angels; PraiÅ¿e him all his HoÅ¿ts; praiÅ¿e yee him Sun and Moone; praiÅ¿e him all yee Å¿tarres of light: Let every thing that hath breath, praiÅ¿e the Lord.</hi> But if it be expected he muÅ¿t extoll him himÅ¿elfe; and not looke for helpe from others; Hee will then extoll him in his exaltation, and Å¿ay; <hi>Bee thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:</hi> Or, he will extoll him in his owne humilitie, by kneeling, and falling downe before him: hee will extoll him in his Å¿ingularitie, and Å¿ay; There is no other God in heaven, or in earth, but onely, thou O God: or he will extoll him in his pluralitie, and Å¿ay; Thou, O God, art wonderfull in thy Being; Three PerÅ¿ons, and one God, bleÅ¿Å¿ed for ever. And if to extoll him with Å¿ayings will not Å¿erve, he will then extoll him with workes, that men Å¿eeing his good workes, may glorifie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16288:37"/> our Father which is in heaven. And if neither words nor workes will be Å¿ufficient; hoe will then extoll him with his Å¿ilence, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: leaving that for Thought which cannot be expreÅ¿t: and leaving that for aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment which cannot be conceived.</p>
            <p>But why is it that <hi>David</hi> will thus extoll God? Is it, that hee may returne a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e anÅ¿werable to the benefit: returne it in the Å¿ame kind, and anÅ¿wer it, as it were in its owne language? He will therefore extoll God, which is a kind of lifting God up: becauÅ¿e God hath lifted him up, which is a kind of extolling of him. For as our extolling of God, is the higheÅ¿t worke of our thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o Gods lifting us up, is the greateÅ¿t benefit of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e. We are thankfull to God, and ought to be, for his other benefits, even for caÅ¿ting us downe: but we uÅ¿e not to extoll him, but for lifting us up: For naturally indeed, wee are all of us deÅ¿irous to bee lifted up; to be Å¿et aloft, and to be high in the world: for this pleaÅ¿eth the eyes, that they may Å¿ee the more, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth the whole body, that it may the more bee Å¿eene: but this is not the lifting up that <hi>David</hi> meanes; but to be lifted up out of danger; and out of the reach of the arme of his enemies. O my Å¿oule, let this bee thy comfort, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thy enemies be many, and great, yet they are not more thy enemies, then they are Gods Å¿laves; and can goe no further, then the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16288:38"/> length of their chaine, which is Å¿eldome Å¿o long to reach to triumphing. Sathan was a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie to <hi>Job,</hi> and had certainly defeated him utterly, if God had not held him Å¿hort in his chaine; and though linke after linke, hee eetched out his chaine to a great length, yet he could never make it reach Å¿o farre, as to a Triumph. For it is not properly a Triumph, but when <hi>Dux Duci arma detrahit;</hi> When one Generall diÅ¿armes another: and this could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done to <hi>Job;</hi> for he kept on his Armour Å¿till; his Helmet of Faith; and his BreÅ¿t-plate of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, hee never let it goe off from him: that there could be no cauÅ¿e for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to triumph. Men commonly are not Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleÅ¿Å¿e themÅ¿elves can triumph over their enemies: but it is enough for me, O Lord, that thou Å¿uffer not my enemies to triumph over me: for I aime not at glory, but at Å¿afetie; I might then ayme at glory, if I were the aÅ¿Å¿ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: but now that I am onely the aÅ¿Å¿ailed; what can I more deÅ¿ire then Å¿afetie, and to bee out of the reach of all my enemies? and Å¿uch Å¿afetie, without any glory, may well give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, Å¿eeing of all the miÅ¿eries that can befall a man in this wretched world; there is none greater, none Å¿o great, as to fall into the hands of enemies, whoÅ¿e Malice, like the fire of Hell, is commonly unquenchable. Let a friend Å¿trike me, and it Å¿hall be a Balme to my head; but to be Å¿trucken by an enemie, who can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16288:38"/> it? The Å¿triking of a friend is out of love, and intends amendment; but the blowes of an enemie are out of malice, and tend to ruine. It troubles mee not, that my enemies rejoyce, Å¿o their rejoycing have no relation to mee: It troubled not <hi>SamÅ¿on</hi> Å¿o much, to have his eyes put out, as to bee brought out before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be the laughing-Å¿tock for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at.</p>
            <p>But why will <hi>David</hi> Å¿peake thus; <hi>Thou haÅ¿t not made my enemies to rejoyce over me:</hi> as though it were God, that made our enemies to rejoyce over us, and not their owne Å¿pitefulneÅ¿Å¿e and malice? Is it, that permiÅ¿Å¿ion is in God a kind of action; and therefore he may juÅ¿tly be Å¿aid to doe that, which he Å¿uffers to be done? Or is it, that in his anger, he makes our enemies the Executioners of his juÅ¿tice: and puniÅ¿heth our neglect of rejoycing in him, with giving them power to rejoyce over us? and Å¿o their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, is not more in us, his judgement; then it is in them his act and operation.</p>
            <p>But what enemies do we talk of, all this while? worldly minds have no feare, but of worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and from Å¿uch, perhaps worldly friends may free them: but the Å¿pirituall man feares rather Å¿piritual enemies; and who can free them from Å¿uch, but onely thou, O God, that art the God of Å¿pirits? O mercifull God, let not Å¿pirituall enemies have the victory over mee; and I make no great reckoning of other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16288:39"/> triumphing: Alas! I know that worldly enemies can never triumph over me, if Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies get not firÅ¿t the victory.</p>
            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, if God have done this for me, have lifted me up above theÅ¿e ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, above theÅ¿e enemies of both kindes, have I not a double cauÅ¿e to extoll him for it, and to praiÅ¿e his Name? And yet I may Å¿ay, I extoll him not more for doing it, then for his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of doing it; <hi>For I cryed unto him, and hee healed mee:</hi> I no Å¿ooner cryed, but hee heard me; he no Å¿ooner heard me, but he healed me; My Å¿uite was no Å¿ooner made, then granted; My diÅ¿eaÅ¿e as Å¿oone cured, as diÅ¿covered; hee kept me not languiÅ¿hing, by drawing out his cure in length; but he applyed a preÅ¿ent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and prevented Hope with haÅ¿t. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I extolled him before for his love, in lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me up above my enemies; Å¿o I muÅ¿t extoll him now for his compaÅ¿Å¿ion, in being moved to doe it, for my onely crying to him; I uÅ¿ed no interceÅ¿Å¿our, but my owne voyce, and hee healed me; and for God to be moved with the cry of a wretched Å¿inner; and Å¿o to be moved, as preÅ¿ently to heale him; Is it not a juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to extoll him, and Å¿ay; O the wonderfull bowels of compaÅ¿Å¿ion that are in God?</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>3</label> To be lifted up from any place, is an act of Power; but the lower the place is, it is the greater act of Mercie; and can there be a lower place then the Grave? at leaÅ¿t, then the grave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16288:39"/> of the Soule? and from this low place, was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> lifted up, as yee may heare himÅ¿elfe Å¿ay; <hi>Thou, O Lord haÅ¿t brought up my Å¿oule from the grave; Thou haÅ¿t kept mee alive, that I Å¿hould not goe downe into the pit.</hi> But is not this a Å¿trange Å¿peech in <hi>David,</hi> as though there were a grave of the Soule, as there is of the Body? for if there be not, how then is it true, that God hath brought up his Å¿oule from the Grave? Is it perhaps, that he calls it the Soule, which is but the cementing of the Body, and life together? or that he calls it the Grave of the Soule, when it is in the loweÅ¿t eÅ¿tate of vivifying the Body? What ever it be, it Å¿hewes a great mercy in God, and a great power of that mercy, to raiÅ¿e him up, that was brought Å¿o low, and to keepe him from falling into the Pit, that was fallen already to the pits brinke. The truth is, that as Å¿inne is the death of the Soule, Å¿o continuance in Å¿inne, is the grave of the Soule; and in this Grave of continuance, did <hi>Davids</hi> Å¿oule lye a long time: (Alas! the Å¿horteÅ¿t time, in this caÅ¿e is long) till God by his quickning Spirit, reÅ¿tored him againe to the life of Grace; that hee had juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay; <hi>Thou, O Lord, haÅ¿t brought up my Å¿oule from the grave, and haÅ¿t kept mee alive, that I Å¿hould not goe downe into the Pit.</hi> Oh how many there are that have bodyes wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king above ground, when their Å¿oules are lying in the Grave? that are luÅ¿tie and Å¿trong in the naturall life; when in the Å¿pirituall life, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16288:40"/> are dead and buryed? yet Å¿o long as they lye not buried above foure dayes, Å¿o long as they continue not in Å¿in Å¿o long, till it have brought the Soule into an abÅ¿olute corruption; there is example in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and where there is Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is hope, they may be raiÅ¿ed againe to life, and be kept from falling into the Pit of perdition. And now, O my Å¿oule, though God have not lifted thee up to as high a place; yet Å¿eeing he hath lifted thee up from as low a place, as he did <hi>David:</hi> haÅ¿t thou not as juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e as he to Å¿ay; <hi>I will extoll thee, O God; for thou haÅ¿t lifted mee up, and haÅ¿t not Å¿uffered my enemies, Å¿inne, and death, to triumph over mee.</hi> And here I find my Å¿elfe Å¿o oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with joy, that I am not able to expreÅ¿Å¿e it without aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance; and what aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance can I looke for, but from the Saints of God? O therefore <hi>Å¿ing unto the Lord, all yee Å¿aints of his; give thankes unto him at the remembrance of his HolineÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> It is not enough to praiÅ¿e him, if yee doe not Å¿ing his praiÅ¿es; for it muÅ¿t be done with cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and exultation; and it is not enough to Å¿ing, if yee doe not praiÅ¿e him; for your joy muÅ¿t be in him, and for him: in his goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and for his glory.</p>
            <p>If it were to Å¿ing of another thing, I Å¿hould require the whole Quire of Gods creatures, to joyne in the Å¿inging; but now, that it is to Å¿ing of Gods holineÅ¿Å¿e; what Å¿hould prophane voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe in the ConÅ¿ort? None but Saints are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16288:40"/> fit to Å¿ing of holineÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿pecially of Gods holineÅ¿Å¿e; but moÅ¿t Å¿pecially with Å¿ongs of holineÅ¿Å¿e. O therefore <hi>Å¿ing to the Lord, all yee Å¿aints of his;</hi> and let your Å¿ongs, be more of his praiÅ¿es, then of your owne thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e: and let your thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, not be Å¿o much for the benefits which you have received; as for the holineÅ¿Å¿e with which they are beÅ¿towed: for God gives not his benefits, as the world uÅ¿eth to doe, out of any corrupt affection, or with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupt intention; but there is a holineÅ¿Å¿e in his giving, as well as in his gifts; and Å¿eeing the Cherubins, and Seraphins doe continually cry to God; Holy, Holy, Holy: You that are his Saints may well afford to Å¿ing to God, at the remembrance of his holineÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>But what holineÅ¿Å¿e can there be in Anger? <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>5</label> and is there not anger in God Å¿ometimes? and will not this then bee a cauÅ¿e, rather of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to thinke of his anger; then of Å¿inging, at the remembrance of his holineÅ¿Å¿e? O my Å¿oule, this need be no cauÅ¿e to breake off the Å¿inging; <hi>for his anger endureth but a moment;</hi> and even anger it Å¿elfe, is in God a holineÅ¿Å¿e; It is none of the things that are naturall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in God; It is but forced upon him by the violence of Å¿inne; and as forced as it is, it Å¿tayes not with him; it is but as a wind that paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth; <hi>Dum oritur moritur;</hi> It dyes in the birth; Nothing lives, and is permanent in God, but onely his favour, and his love, and therefore,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16288:41"/> 
               <hi>Though weeping may endure for a night, yet joy commeth in the morning.</hi> And Å¿eeing our life is of this condition, that heavineÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ometimes muÅ¿t as well be had as joy; it is happy for us, they are Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, that heavineÅ¿Å¿e comes but in the Evening, when wee may Å¿leepe it out; and when our Å¿enÅ¿es are apt to be tyed up from feeling it: but joy commeth in the Morning; when all our Å¿enÅ¿es are waking to entertaine it. What is the Evening, but the end of the day? and what is the Evening of our life, but the end of our dayes? and in this Evening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is commonly heavineÅ¿Å¿e; weeping for parting of friends that have lived together: but this heavineÅ¿Å¿e is removed aÅ¿Å¿oone as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes; for what is the Morning, but when the Sunne riÅ¿eth againe? and what is our Morning, but when we Å¿hall riÅ¿e againe? and as when this morning comes, there will bee a day that Å¿hall have no more Evening; Å¿o when this joy comes, all teares Å¿hall be wiped from our eyes, and there Å¿hall be no more weeping. Indeed all our great joyes have ever come in the morning: It was a Joy that came in the morning, at the Birth of ChriÅ¿t; It was a Joy that came in the morning, at the ReÅ¿urrection of ChriÅ¿t; It was a Joy that came in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at the DeÅ¿cending of the Holy GhoÅ¿t upon the ApoÅ¿tles; and theÅ¿e Joyes were then Å¿o great, that they have made us FeaÅ¿ts ever Å¿ince: <hi>(Our ChriÅ¿tmaÅ¿Å¿e, our EaÅ¿ter, and our Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ontide:)</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:16288:41"/> yet theÅ¿e Joyes had their heavineÅ¿Å¿e preceding: the Joy of ChriÅ¿ts birth, had the heavineÅ¿Å¿e of his Mothers Å¿light; the Joy of ChriÅ¿ts ReÅ¿urrection, had the heavineÅ¿Å¿e for his PaÅ¿Å¿ion: the Joy of the DeÅ¿cending of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, the heavineÅ¿Å¿e for ChriÅ¿ts depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but theÅ¿e heavineÅ¿Å¿es were Å¿o preÅ¿ently followed with joyes, that it hath made this AphoriÅ¿me be found true Å¿till; <hi>HeavineÅ¿Å¿e may endure for a night, but joy commeth in the morning.</hi> And now, O my Å¿oule, what need it trouble thee, to have heavineÅ¿Å¿e in the Evening, Å¿o long as thou art Å¿ure to have joy in the morning? What need it trouble thee to be weeping for a time, when thou art Å¿ure of rejoycing, when time Å¿hall be no more?</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have beene buÅ¿ie about Å¿inging Gods praiÅ¿es, for lifting mee up, which hath beene his worke; Now I muÅ¿t leave Å¿inging, and come to Å¿aying, to Å¿peake of my owne worke; <hi>And I Å¿aid in my proÅ¿peritie, I Å¿hall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>7</label> better then my Å¿aying, it had beene better for me, to have held my peace in both: for what a Å¿aying is this, to Å¿ay; <hi>I Å¿hall never be moved?</hi> Is there any Mountaine Å¿o Å¿trong, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved? and if no Mountaine, how any man? but this is the inÅ¿olent language of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿peritie, to give over crying to God, and fall a boaÅ¿ting of it Å¿elfe. Alas! ProÅ¿peritie hath neither good tongue, nor good eyes; as it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16288:42"/> made <hi>David</hi> Å¿ay, hee Å¿hould never be moved; Å¿o it made him thinke it enough, that God by his favour had made his Mountaine Å¿trong; but as for the maintaining it Å¿trong, to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that to himÅ¿elfe: when God knowes, if once we leave depending upon God, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing to our Å¿elves, our Mountaine will Å¿oone bee turned into a Valley, and our Å¿trength will goe from us, as it did from <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on,</hi> when his haire was cut off; and this makes <hi>David</hi> Å¿ay now; <hi>Thou didÅ¿t hide thy face, and I was troubled:</hi> for as it is the favour of God, that makes our Mountaine Å¿trong; and our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine being Å¿trong, wee are kept from trouble: Å¿o it is the hiding of Gods face, that makes our moutaine weake; and our mountaine being weake, wee are preÅ¿ently troubled; but rather indeed, if God doe not as well maintaine our mountaine Å¿trong, as make it Å¿trong, we Å¿hall quickly bring our Mountaine to a Mole-hill; wee Å¿hall quickly either fall our Å¿elves from our Mountaine; or have our mountaine to fall upon us.</p>
            <p>Wee Å¿ee the Earth hath no comfort but in the Sunne; and therefore if the Sunne bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Earth preÅ¿ently puts on Blacks; is pincht with cold, and covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e: That which the Sunne is to the Earth; thy Face, O God, is to me, and what marvell then, when thou hideÅ¿t thy face; if I bee left, as a diÅ¿conÅ¿olate Earth, in trouble and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16288:42"/> God uÅ¿eth not to hide his face from any that depend upon him; and therefore as long as I put my truÅ¿t and confidence in him, he was to me as a Å¿trong Mountain; I enjoyed his favour, and the light of his Countenance; but aÅ¿Å¿oone as I left depending upon him, and truÅ¿ted to my owne Å¿trength, my Mountaine was Å¿uddenly turned into a Valley; and I was left alas in a vale of miÅ¿erie. O therefore, my Å¿oule, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding any proÅ¿peritie whatÅ¿oever; Doe thou depend upon God for thy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, both for making it Å¿trong, and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing it Å¿trong, and never bee moved to Å¿ay, thou Å¿halt never be moved; for to bee immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, is a priviledge of God himÅ¿elfe, and of God alone, and is not communicable to any creature. It is a falÅ¿e Å¿aying in any eÅ¿tate to Å¿ay; <hi>I Å¿hall never be moved;</hi> but in proÅ¿peritie, falÅ¿eÅ¿t of all: for hee that is in proÅ¿peritie, Å¿tands in a Å¿lipperie place, and Å¿uch a place is not capable of Å¿tabilitie. What is proÅ¿peritie but an earthy thing? and can any thing that is earthy be Å¿ecure from moving, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earth it Å¿elfe is moved? O my Å¿oule, the conÅ¿ideration of this; Alas! the feeling of this hath made mee leave, both Å¿inging, and Å¿aying, and fall to my crying againe: <hi>I cryed to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made Å¿uppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>8</label> Indeed crying is the voyce of a Å¿uppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and the fitteÅ¿t voyce for a Å¿upplication: but yet why Å¿hould <hi>David</hi> tell God of his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16288:43"/> crying to him, and Å¿ay; <hi>I cryed to thee, O Lord;</hi> as though God knew it not, without his tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it? No doubt, God knew of his crying, for how elÅ¿e did he heare it? and of his Å¿uppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for how elÅ¿e could hee grant it? and therefore it Å¿eemes, hee tells it not Å¿o much to God, as to us; that wee may take notice, with what Å¿acrifices God is pleaÅ¿ed. For as there are divers Å¿acrifices that are acceptable to God: Å¿o each of them, in the due time, is the fitteÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t acceptable: Å¿inging, fitteÅ¿t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a benefit obtained; and crying, fitteÅ¿t for obtaining a benefit: Allelujahs fitteÅ¿t, when wee are in triumph: HoÅ¿anna's, fitteÅ¿t when we are in diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e. And therefore being at the preÅ¿ent, in perill of his life; and delivered as it were into the hands of Death; the Å¿acrifice he offers now, is a Å¿upplication; which yet Å¿eemes not Å¿o much a Å¿upplication, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tulation; <label type="milestone">

Though the Å¿ervice I can doe thee be not great, yet it is more then duÅ¿t can doe: Hath duÅ¿t a tongue, or a voyce, or any inÅ¿truments of life, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of thy truth? and why then wilt thou make a divorce of parts, which thou haÅ¿t joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together of purpoÅ¿e, for that purpoÅ¿e? If I deÅ¿ired life for any end of my owne, thou hadÅ¿t juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e then, to make an end of my life; but now that I deÅ¿ire it, to doe thee Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, why wilt thou diminiÅ¿h the number of thy Å¿ervants, and not leave enow for the Å¿ervice thou haÅ¿t to doe? Can any number be Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to praiÅ¿e thee? Can there ever be mouthes enow to declare thy Truth? and may not I make one, a Å¿infull one I know; but yet one in the number, if thou but pleaÅ¿e to Å¿pare mee for deÅ¿cending into the Pit? But what Pit? I meane not the Pit, where the ApoÅ¿tate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are; I know they deÅ¿cended not, but fell; and I know the Pit they fell into, is a Pit of blaÅ¿phemie: the Pit I feare deÅ¿cending into, is but a Pit of Å¿ilence, and yet in one thing, is worÅ¿e then theirs; for they in their Pit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their Å¿ubÅ¿tance Å¿till; but I in this, Å¿hall loÅ¿e my very Being; at leaÅ¿t, the <hi>quantitas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua</hi> of my body, Å¿hall bee turned into the <hi>quantitas DiÅ¿creta</hi> of duÅ¿t: and the frame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of all the Elements diÅ¿Å¿olved; I Å¿hall

               <hi>Heare, O Lord; and have mercy upon me, Lord, bee thou my helper:</hi> for if thou lend mee not thine eare, how can I hope thou wilt Å¿hew mee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? and if thou have not mercy upon me, how can I hope thou wilt bee my helper? Heare me, O God, while I am in a place, where I may be heard; for if once I be deÅ¿cended into the Pit, I Å¿hall quite then be out of all hearing. Have mercy upon me, while I am capable of mercy; for if once I be turned into duÅ¿t, what mercy can I looke for? Be thou my helper, O God, now that I am in a Å¿tate to bee helped; for if my bloud in which my life conÅ¿iÅ¿ts bee once Å¿hed; what good then will thy helpe doe me? I place Gods mercy in the midÅ¿t here, becauÅ¿e it muÅ¿t Å¿erve to both the other; both to make God to heare me, and to make him to helpe me: and Gods mercy can doe both; it can make him to heare me, though I were Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and can make him to helpe me, though I were duÅ¿t. But though Gods mercy can doe it, am I Å¿ure it will doe it? O my Å¿oule, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath done it already: for it is the worke of his mercy, that <hi>Hee hath turned my mourning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dauncing, that hee hath put off my Å¿ackcloth, and girded mee with gladneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> O wonderfull converÅ¿ion; the very Å¿ame myracle, I may Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t wrought at the Mariage in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16288:44"/> 
               <hi>Cana,</hi> for to turne Mourning into Dauncing; what is it, but to turne water into Wine? To have turned my mourning, but into comfort, had beene a great worke, and a great favour: but to turne my mourning into dauncing; the extremitie of Å¿orrow, into extremitie of joy; who could doe this, but thou onely, O God; with whom, as no Myracles are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Å¿o no extremities are limits. Mourning is not properly, but for one that is dead: and indeed Å¿o neere being dead was I, that I might well be Å¿aid to mourne for my owne death: not unlike the Swan; if it be true, that Å¿hee Å¿ings her owne Elegie: and now to have my mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning turned into dauncing; the drooping act for Death, be turned into the moÅ¿t lively act of Life: what is it, but the Myracle, as it were, of ReÅ¿urrection, and AÅ¿cention both at once? at leaÅ¿t, from the loweÅ¿t Å¿tayre of miÅ¿erie, to be raiÅ¿ed to the higheÅ¿t of happineÅ¿Å¿e: and not <hi>Gradatim,</hi> by degrees and Å¿teps, but <hi>per Å¿altum,</hi> by a motion more Å¿wift, than the Fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, that carried up <hi>Elias</hi> into Heaven: and Å¿o the change not more wonderfull, then the Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneÅ¿Å¿e; Mourning turned into Dauncing, a wonderfull change; and done, as it were, in the turning of a hand, as wonderfull a Å¿uddenneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>And now to make me fit for Dauncing; <hi>Thou haÅ¿t put off my Å¿ackcloth, and girded me with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> for indeed, if I had kept on my Å¿ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth Å¿till; I Å¿hould have made but a heavie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16288:45"/> Dauncer; but now, that my Å¿ackcloth is off, and I am girded with gladneÅ¿Å¿e; I Å¿hall leape as light, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to Å¿ee thy day.</p>
            <p>I put on Å¿ackcloth when I was a Mourner; but now that I am to be a Dauncer, I am girded with gladneÅ¿s: and if I mourned before, to think of Gods anger; may I not juÅ¿tly daunce now, to thinke of his favour? If I put on Å¿ackcloth before, as Å¿orrowing for my Å¿inne; may I not juÅ¿tly now be girded with gladneÅ¿Å¿e, as rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in my Saviour? For though it be Gods mercy, that hath done this for me, yet it is his mercy in ChriÅ¿t my Saviour: without whom, his mercy alone would never have done it: He would never have put off my Å¿ackcloth, and girded me with gladneÅ¿Å¿e, but for his Å¿ake, and through his meanes, that was anoynted with the Oyle of gladneÅ¿Å¿e above his fellowes. My Å¿ackcloth was but a looÅ¿e garment about mee, which might eaÅ¿ily be put off at pleaÅ¿ure, but my gladneÅ¿Å¿e is girt about me, to bee faÅ¿t and Å¿ure, and cannot leave me, though it would; at leaÅ¿t, none Å¿hall be able to take it from me.</p>
            <p>And now, though this be Å¿poken here in the caÅ¿e of <hi>David,</hi> yet it may bee conceived as in Type for all the godly: if they mourne, and lye in Å¿ackcloth now; yet they Å¿hall ere long be girded with GladneÅ¿Å¿e, and daunce for joy; but what Dauncing? Not like that of <hi>Herodias</hi> Daughter; for which <hi>Herod</hi> allowed her to aske halfe his Kingdome; but like that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:16288:45"/> before the Arke; for which God without asking, will give us a whole Kingdome. And when Å¿hall the time bee? Alas! it cannot be long: For they Å¿hall not goe out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the old IÅ¿raelites did, by the tedious paÅ¿Å¿ages of a troubleÅ¿ome WilderneÅ¿Å¿e; but their Mourning Å¿hall be turned into Dauncing: a converÅ¿ion as Å¿udden, as when <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous hand was turned to be Å¿ound againe, by putting it onely in his boÅ¿ome.</p>
            <p>But to what end is it, that God hath done <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>12</label> this for me? It may be thought, becauÅ¿e hee hath turned my Mourning into Dauncing, and hath girded me with GladneÅ¿Å¿e; that hee hath done it to this end, that I might live in jollity, and Å¿pend my time with <hi>BelÅ¿hazzar,</hi> in revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and feaÅ¿ting: but there is no Å¿uch matter: hee hath done it to this end, <hi>that my glory may Å¿ing praiÅ¿e unto him, and not bee Å¿ilent:</hi> to this end, that not onely I may praiÅ¿e him, but may Å¿ing his praiÅ¿es; and not onely that I, but that my glory may Å¿ing them; and alas what glory have I? doth not all glory belong to God? Indeed Å¿o it is, my glory then Å¿ings his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, when I aÅ¿cribe to him all praiÅ¿e and glory; my glory then Å¿ings his prayÅ¿es, when I praiÅ¿e him with all I have to glory in, with all the faculties and powers of my Å¿oule and body; thoÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially in which I was made after his Image, for this is my Glory.</p>
            <p>If this then bee the end that God intends,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16288:46"/> Å¿hall I be Å¿o ungratefull, to croÅ¿Å¿e his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? if hee have given mee a Tongue, and a Voyce to Å¿erve him; Å¿hall I hold my peace, and be Å¿ilent in his Å¿ervice? if he have turned my Mourning into Dauncing; Å¿hall I bee Å¿ullen, and Å¿low to Å¿ing his PrayÅ¿es? Alas! my Daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing can never be kindly without MuÅ¿ick; and what muÅ¿ick Å¿o fit for it, as Å¿inging? and what Å¿inging Å¿o fit, as to the Ditty of his PrayÅ¿es? O my Å¿oule, Å¿eeing God hath procured thee libertie to Daunce, thou mayÅ¿t well afford to find the muÅ¿ick: and yet neither my Dauncing Å¿hall hearken to the muÅ¿icke, nor my Å¿ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿hall looke toward the Dauncing; but my Singing and my Dauncing both, Å¿hall bee addreÅ¿Å¿ed, and directed to God alone. Shall my heart be Å¿o Å¿et upon my joy, as to make me forget the Authour of my joy? No, O God, my joy hath Å¿o Å¿ure a foundation, that I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be unmindfull of the Founder: <hi>I will give thankes to thee, O Lord, my God, for ever.</hi> Not for a time which will ceaÅ¿e; Not as long as the Sunne and Moone endure, which Å¿hall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes endure; not as long as I have breath in my body; No my Å¿oule, but as long as thou thy Å¿elfe haÅ¿t Being; which being breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee by God, Å¿hall never ceaÅ¿e; Å¿hall alwayes endure; Å¿hall be forever.</p>
            <p>When I extolled God, I had relation to his Omnipotencie: when I Å¿ung his PrayÅ¿es, to his Mercie; and now that I give him thankes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16288:46"/> for ever, to his Eternitie: that now I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and Å¿ay; O Almightie, moÅ¿t Mercifull, and ever-living God; to thee be aÅ¿cribed all Honour, PrayÅ¿e, and Glory, world without end.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Las! what a Vow is this that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>1</label> 
               <hi>David</hi> makes here? a Vow which hee is Å¿ure before hand, he cannot keepe: for is it poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to bleÅ¿Å¿e God at all times? Is there not a time of paine and miÅ¿erie, in which <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded him to curÅ¿e God and dye? and can curÅ¿ing of God, Å¿tand with bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God? O my Å¿oule, I take not my meaÅ¿ure of bleÅ¿Å¿ing God from the laÅ¿t of that wicked Woman; it is not paine; it is not miÅ¿erie; it is not extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of paine, or miÅ¿erie, that Å¿hall make mee to breake my Vow in bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God: but if it be thought Å¿o great a matter to bleÅ¿Å¿e God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ery; I will Å¿tretch my Vow yet further, for I will bleÅ¿Å¿e him for miÅ¿erie: and I may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16288:50"/> truly Å¿ay, if it were not for paine, and miÅ¿ery; I Å¿hould want one Å¿peciall Motive for bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God.</p>
            <p>But yet there is a time of Å¿leepe, which is a tribute due to Nature; and is it poÅ¿Å¿ible to pay the tribute of Å¿leepe to Nature, and the tribute of bleÅ¿Å¿ing to God, both at once? If then Å¿leepe be of neceÅ¿Å¿itie Å¿o oftentimes, how can bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God be performed at all times? O my Å¿oule, when our waking is terminated with bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God; that bleÅ¿Å¿ing is in force till we wake againe: for as in what place the tree falleth, there it lyeth: Å¿o in what Å¿tate the Soule goes to reÅ¿t, in that Å¿tate it reÅ¿teth: If my Å¿oule Å¿ay to God; I will lay mee downe to Å¿leepe, for it is Thou, Lord, onely that Å¿uÅ¿taineÅ¿t me; my Å¿oule Å¿hall have it returned from God; Thus the Lord giveth his beloved Å¿leepe.</p>
            <p>But if thus perhaps be made good the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of BleÅ¿Å¿ing God: yet in what conÅ¿iÅ¿ts the worke of bleÅ¿Å¿ing him? Is it onely in Thought, or onely in a good intention? No my Å¿oule; <hi>his praiÅ¿e Å¿hall continually bee in my mouth:</hi> for though the heart indeed bee the Fountaine of bleÅ¿Å¿ing him: yet out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the heart, the mouth Å¿peaketh; and therefore it Å¿hall not be cloyÅ¿tered up in the Cells of Å¿ilence, but it Å¿hall have vent, and bee brought into the light; that if it bee not Å¿aid, that men Å¿eeing my good workes, it may at leaÅ¿t be Å¿aid, that men hearing my good words,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16288:50"/> may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. But doe I not by this, fall againe upon my old difficultie? for if it Å¿eemed impoÅ¿Å¿ible before to bleÅ¿Å¿e God at all times, may it not juÅ¿tly Å¿eeme as impoÅ¿Å¿ible now, that his PraiÅ¿e Å¿hould continually be in my mouth? It may perhaps be true of the Angels, in whoÅ¿e mouthes wee know of nothing there is continually, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath: but to be verefied of the mouthes of men, Å¿eemes a thing impoÅ¿Å¿ible; for is there not a neceÅ¿Å¿itie of Å¿peaking many things, beÅ¿ides Gods praiÅ¿es? yet nothing muÅ¿t bee Å¿poken, but either his PraiÅ¿e, or to his praiÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e wee breake our Vow. And how then is this Riddle to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? Is it not as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it: <hi>Whither yee eat, or drinke, or whatÅ¿oever yee doe elÅ¿e; let all be done to the praiÅ¿e, and glory of God.</hi> And if all wee doe, may bee done to the praiÅ¿e of God, then certainly all we Å¿peake, may bee Å¿poken to the praiÅ¿e of God: and indeed, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he never ceaÅ¿eth to Å¿end forth continually his bleÅ¿Å¿ings; with what reaÅ¿on can we ceaÅ¿e to Å¿et forth continually his PraiÅ¿es?</p>
            <p>But when I make this Vow to bleÅ¿Å¿e God at all times; I make it not preÅ¿uming upon any abilitie in my Å¿elfe: Alas! I know my owne weakneÅ¿Å¿e, and how unready I am to any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e; <hi>but my Å¿oule maketh her boaÅ¿t in the Lord:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>2</label> My confidence is, that he who hath given mee the reÅ¿olution to will it, will give mee alÅ¿o the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16288:51"/> power to performe it; that Hee who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the worke, will alÅ¿o finiÅ¿h it; and being Å¿o good an Architect, as he is, will not lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but will as well alÅ¿o Å¿et on the Roofe. If I Å¿hould boaÅ¿t in my Å¿elfe, I Å¿hould doe wrong to God: but if I boaÅ¿t not in God, I doe wrong to my Å¿elfe: Å¿eeing God is a Å¿trength to none, but to them that make him their Å¿trength; and none make him their Å¿trength, but they that make their boaÅ¿t of him. It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring BoaÅ¿ting, and Humilitie, to meet together in one Å¿ubject, betweene which there is Å¿o naturall an Antipathie: yet here it is done: for this I may Å¿ay is the humble boaÅ¿ting; where a vaine man may glory without vaine-glory, where a weake Agent may preÅ¿ume without preÅ¿umption: Not like the boaÅ¿ting of the PhariÅ¿ee, Å¿o hatefull in the eyes of God, Å¿o offenÅ¿ive in the eares of the humble: For the <hi>Humble can heare this boaÅ¿ting, and bee glad,</hi> which they would never doe; if it were not conformable to the rules of Humility. Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boaÅ¿ting be greater then to Å¿ay; <hi>I can doe all things?</hi> yet in this boaÅ¿ting, there is humilitie, when I adde; <hi>In him that comforteth mee.</hi> For though God like not of boaÅ¿ting; yet he likes of this boaÅ¿ting, which arrogates nothing to our Å¿elves, but aÅ¿cribes all to him: and Å¿eeing my Å¿oule boaÅ¿teth her felfe of God, I doubt not, but as the humble heare it, and bee glad; Å¿o God Å¿ees it, and is pleaÅ¿ed, and accepts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16288:51"/> my BoaÅ¿ting as a Å¿acrifice of Humilitie.</p>
            <p>But to what end is it that my BoaÅ¿ting tends? Is it to Å¿et forth my owne worthineÅ¿Å¿e, and to vaunt of my abilities? Is it to tread in the Å¿teps of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or to walke in the way of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ee?

            <p>But why is it that I Å¿ought him? is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e I had loÅ¿t him before? and why Å¿hould I Å¿eeke to get him againe, and would not keepe him, when I had him?

            <p>But O the tender mercies of God, that hath not Å¿uffered me to put off, my Å¿eeking him Å¿o long: for, O my Å¿oule, it is no leÅ¿Å¿e his mercie that I Å¿eeke him, then that hee heares me; my deÅ¿ire is not more to have him, then his to bee had; for how elÅ¿e could he have heard mee as Å¿oone as I Å¿ought him, but that hee Å¿tood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tening, as it were, when I would Å¿eeke him? and he heard me not as one that were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whither he head me or no; but he gave me audience with no leÅ¿Å¿e Intention to grant my Å¿uit, then attention to know it; for heare the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e of my Å¿eeking him; Å¿ee the fruit of his hearing me; <hi>He delivered mee from all my feares;</hi> To have delivered mee from all my troubles, had beene a great favour; but a farre greater, to

No, God knowes, though they be not in trouble like other men, yet they live in more feare then other men; GuiltineÅ¿Å¿e of mind, or mind of the world never Å¿uffers them to be Å¿ecure; though they bee free Å¿ometimes from the fit of an Ague, yet they are never without a grudging: and (if I may uÅ¿e the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion of Poets) though they feele not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Whippe of <hi>TyÅ¿iphone,</hi> yet they feele alwayes her terrours; and Å¿eeing the Lord hath done this for me, hath delivered me from all my feares; have I not cauÅ¿e, juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to magnifie him, and exalt his Name?</p>
            <p>But is Gods mercy confined onely to mee, and not extended as well to others? Yes, my Å¿oule, <hi>Deus omnibus idem;</hi> God is good to all: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>5</label> his mercy is over all his workes; Not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, as being above them all; but over them as extended to them all: for other as well as I, <hi>Looked unto him, and were lightened.</hi> But Å¿hould it not bee rather Å¿aid; God looked to them, and they were lightened, then to Å¿ay; They looked to God, and were lightened? For God is Light, and when the Light lookes to us, we are Å¿ure to be lightened: but wee that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16288:53"/> are darkneÅ¿Å¿e may looke to the Light, and yet continue in darkneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿till? but is it not, that the influence of Gods favour deÅ¿cends upon the godly in a kind of correÅ¿pondence to their Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: if they cry, they Å¿hall be heard: if they mourne, they Å¿hall be comforted; if they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themÅ¿elves, they Å¿hall be exalted; Å¿o here, becauÅ¿e they looked to God, they were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. Indeed Light is the proper inheritance of the godly, as being the children of light; which though they cannot deÅ¿erve, yet they may expect; and have they not reaÅ¿on then to looke to him, in whom it is, and from whom it muÅ¿t come? They little deÅ¿erve to be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that will not looke to him that is their light: If it may be had for a looke, and they will not doe that; they worthily deÅ¿erve to be kept in darkneÅ¿Å¿e. It is true, all would be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but all take not the right courÅ¿e; they looke not the right way: There are Å¿ome that looke to the Å¿tarres to bee lightened, becauÅ¿e the Å¿tarres indeed are glorious bodyes, and give light to the world; and theÅ¿e are Å¿uch as attribute all to Chance, and Fortune: and there are Å¿ome, and theÅ¿e the worÅ¿t Å¿ome, that looke to <hi>Lucifer</hi> to be lightened, becauÅ¿e they thinke he beares not his name for nought; and theÅ¿e are Å¿uch as light them Candles of impietie, and by impietie: but theÅ¿e are deluÅ¿ions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tures: the way to bee truly lightened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is to looke to God: for hee is the Father
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16288:54"/> of Lights: and as there is nothing with him; Å¿o there comes nothing from him, but onely Light. O then, my Å¿oule, looke to God, and he will lighten thee; looke to him with the eye of Faith, and the light of his Countenance Å¿hall Å¿hine upon thee.</p>
            <p>But though the children of the world bee wiÅ¿er in their Generation, then the children of Light; yet in this, the godly are the wiÅ¿er: <hi>for they looked to God, and were lightened: and their faces were not aÅ¿hamed:</hi> But may wee not Å¿ay then, the more Å¿hame for them? for is it not true which is Å¿aid, that nothing belongs to us, but confuÅ¿ion, and Å¿hame of face? may we not be aÅ¿hamed to Å¿hew our faces to God, being Å¿o foule, and filthy as they are, Å¿eeing hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures nothing that is uncleane? O my Å¿oule, as they that looked to the Brazen Serpent were preÅ¿ently healed; Å¿o they that looke to God, are preÅ¿ently lightened: for though looking to the materiall Sunne, bee a cauÅ¿e to Å¿tayne, and tanne the face: yet looking to the Sunne of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is a meanes to cleanÅ¿e it, and make it amiable: and why then Å¿hould they be aÅ¿hamed? Is it any Å¿hame to Å¿hew our Å¿ores to our PhyÅ¿itian? or any Å¿hame to Å¿hew our faults to our ConfeÅ¿Å¿our? No more is it any Å¿hame to Å¿hew our faces to God, though never Å¿o foule, and Å¿o full of Å¿taynes, Å¿eeing hee is the true PhyÅ¿itian that onely can cure us; Hee the true ConfeÅ¿Å¿our that onely can abÅ¿olve us.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:16288:54"/>
            <p>But who are they that were lightened? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Pauci quos aequus amavit:</hi> Å¿ome few that were in his favour; perhaps rich men that could offer him Hecatombes, and plentifull Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: No my Å¿oule; <hi>The poore man cryed, and hee heard him: and Å¿aved him out of all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>6</label> for God is no accepter of perÅ¿ons; Hee neither regards the legges of the Å¿trong, nor the faces of the beautifull, nor the wealth of the rich; but whoÅ¿oever they be that looke to him, and feare him, they are Å¿ure to taÅ¿te of his mercy and goodneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>But though the poore man cryed, are wee Å¿ure he cryed to God? hee might cry out of Å¿enÅ¿e of his miÅ¿ery; and what were this to move God to heare? O my Å¿oule, any crying of the godly, is a MuÅ¿ick with which God is pleaÅ¿ed, or at leaÅ¿t is moved: if it bee a crying out of Å¿enÅ¿e of miÅ¿erie, God is moved with it in his mercy, if a crying out of Devotion; God is pleaÅ¿ed with it in his JuÅ¿tice. O then my Å¿oule, rather never cry, then not cry to God: for by crying to him, thou getteÅ¿t, I may Å¿ay, two Å¿trings to thy bow: both his Mercie, and his JuÅ¿tice: and were it not folly to leave out one, where thou mayÅ¿t have both? But though wee know not what the poore mans crying was, yet wee Å¿ee what Gods hearing was: for hearing him, hee Å¿aved him from all his troubles: and who would not cry, to be Å¿o heard? The world may thinke it a Å¿trange
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16288:55"/> courÅ¿e in the poore man, to cry to God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from his troubles, being Å¿o farre off from him: but how farre was hee from him, when he heard him? If hee were Å¿o neere to him, that he might heare him, hee could not be Å¿o farre from him, but he might helpe him. O my Å¿oule, let the world thinke their pleaÅ¿ure; let them Å¿tudie, and plot, and caÅ¿t about how to bring their purpoÅ¿es to paÅ¿Å¿e; Doe thou cry to God to deliver thee from thy troubles; for if thou cry, thou mayÅ¿t be Å¿ure hee will heare thee; and if he heare, thou needÅ¿t not doubt but he will helpe thee. But yet miÅ¿take not the meaning, when it is Å¿ayd, that God Å¿aved him from all his troubles; as though, becauÅ¿e hee was a poore man, that therefore hee was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently made rich: Or if he were in paine, that he had preÅ¿ently eaÅ¿e: for God goes not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ordinary way of PhyÅ¿icians, to cure cold DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es with hot Medicines; his wayes of deliverance are often-times Å¿pirituall; and Å¿o <hi>Job</hi> might be Å¿aid to bee delivered from all his troubles, when God gave him patience to endure his troubles; but Å¿pecially <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be Å¿aid to bee delivered from his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when he was carryed by Angels into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> boÅ¿ome.</p>

O my Å¿oule, this is Å¿o, and yet wee thinke our Å¿elves not Å¿afe enough: and may it not then be juÅ¿tly Å¿aid; <hi>What doubt yee of, O yee of jittle faith?</hi> But how can wee thinke there be Angells to guard us; when we Å¿carce thinke there be any Angels? for if there bee, they muÅ¿t bee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God: and then certainly creatures of a moÅ¿t excellent nature: and would <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> then have left them out, in his Catalogue of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he reckons them all up? Indeed for this very reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a moÅ¿t excellent Nature, hath <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> left them out: for hee Å¿peakes but of materiall Creatures, in this materiall world; of which number, the Angels are none. But wee may thinke perhaps there are none, becauÅ¿e wee can Å¿ee none: as though we could Å¿ee a thing that is inviÅ¿ible? Å¿hall we therefore thinke we have no Å¿oules, becauÅ¿e we cannot Å¿ee our Å¿oules? Wee live now by Faith, and not by Å¿ight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can neither Å¿ee Å¿oules nor Angels; we Å¿hall then Å¿ee both, when we Å¿hall live by Å¿ight, and not by Faith. Alas! if we beleeve no more then we Å¿ee, we Å¿eeme not to live by Faith neither, for Faith beleeves that which it cannot Å¿ee: Oh therefore my Å¿oule, to make it appeare thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿t, and that thou liveÅ¿t by Faith; let this be an
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16288:56"/> Article of thy Creed, that the Angels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe and pitch their Tents about thee: that if at any time thou bee aÅ¿Å¿aulted, if aÅ¿Å¿aulted by enemies, if by an Army of enemies, thou maiÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e to the confidence of this Guard, and never tremble for any Alarum: Å¿eeing there are more with us, then are againÅ¿t us.</p>
            <p>But how can the godly thinke they have a Guard about them, when it is for Princes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have a Guard; and the godly for the moÅ¿t part are but private men? O my Å¿oule, this is a Guard that attends no leÅ¿Å¿e the pooreÅ¿t man, then the greateÅ¿t Prince, and attends him with as much carefulneÅ¿Å¿e, as if he were a Prince.</p>
            <p>But if there be Angels to defend the godly, why doe they not defend them? why doe they Å¿uffer them to be Å¿o moleÅ¿ted, Å¿o afflicted as they are? for who are in Å¿uch troubles, who groane under Å¿uch afflictions as the godly? and would this be Å¿o, if that were Å¿o? would they be Å¿o oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, if they had Angels to relieve them? O my Å¿oule, thou little conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereÅ¿t the infinite benefits that the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive by the miniÅ¿terie of Angels.

Is there not an Army of malignant Å¿pirits to aÅ¿Å¿ault them, and could they be Å¿afe from tearing in peeces; if there were not a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16288:56"/> campe of Angels to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them? But though the Angels be a guard to the whole man, both body and Å¿oule; yet being creatures Å¿pirituall and inviÅ¿ible; they are chiefly a guard to the inviÅ¿ible and Å¿pirituall part, which is the Å¿oule. The body they know muÅ¿t goe to the earth, and therefore though a part, is the leaÅ¿t part of their care: It is the Soule they chiefly waite upon, becauÅ¿e it is the Å¿oule they chiefly waite for: for they Å¿tand waiting for the Å¿oule, when it Å¿hall leave the body, that they may take it, and carry it into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boÅ¿ome: for till then they breake not up their Campe.</p>
            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, Å¿eeing the Angels are Å¿o beneficiall, and Å¿o good unto us; <hi>Oh taÅ¿t, <label type="milestone">

O that men would underÅ¿tand how to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things that are truly good indeed, and things that but onely Å¿eeme good! we Å¿hould then have a better world then wee have, and men would never complaine of want, when they have but too much: never bee Å¿o earneÅ¿t for Å¿upply of things, that truly conÅ¿idered, are but meerely Å¿uperfluous. If therefore one that feares God be in any want, we may know that the thing he wants is not good: for if it were good, he Å¿hould not want it: it may perhaps be good in it Å¿elfe, but not good for him, and if not good for him, hee cannot be truly Å¿aid to want it, becauÅ¿e indeed he were better be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>But is Feare a thing of Å¿uch force to Å¿upply our wants? One would rather thinke that boldneÅ¿Å¿e and courage Å¿hould Å¿upply them? No my Å¿oule, for what creature Å¿o couragious <label type="milestone">

It is a Feare that is joyned with Joy: a Feare, not to offend: but a Joy, for not offending: It is a Feare, not Å¿o much of Gods juÅ¿tice, as of his Mercy: for there is mercy with him that hee may bee feared: It is not a Feare that will Å¿horten your life, but be a meanes to prolong it: but then it muÅ¿t not be a bare Å¿peculative feare, but you muÅ¿t put it in practiÅ¿e: and theÅ¿e may bee the rules: <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill, and thy lippes <label type="milestone">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16288:59"/> promiÅ¿ed before, to them that honour their Parents; and here it is promiÅ¿ed againe to them that love their Neighbours; for theÅ¿e Rules are as the whole body of morall PhiloÅ¿ophie, and are therefore delivered in Å¿ixe parts, like the Å¿ix Commandements of the Å¿econd Table; which onely concerne our dutie to Neighbours: and in all of them the qualitie of chiefe Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and which keepes then all in tune, is Feare; <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill,</hi> for feare of the evill that may enÅ¿ue: <hi>and thy lips from Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king guile,</hi> for feare leÅ¿t thy guile bee diÅ¿cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thy Å¿hame. <hi>Depart from evill;</hi> for feare of infecting: <hi>and doe good,</hi> for feare of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: <hi>Seeke peace,</hi> for feare of wanting it; <hi>and purÅ¿ue it,</hi> for feare of loÅ¿ing it. The two firÅ¿t Precepts are the dutie of words, for words muÅ¿t firÅ¿t be regulated, before workes can bee actuated; and they are both Negative; <hi>Keepe thy tongue from evill: and thy lips from Å¿peaking guile:</hi> for it is not required of the tongue to be Eloquent; or of the lips to deliver Oracles: It is enough in the tongue, if it be not irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Å¿uperiours, nor detracting from equalls: It is enough in the lips, if they be not charmes to deceive, nor Equivocations to delude.</p>
            <p>The other Precepts are the dutie of workes, and they are foure; where the Precepts of words were but two; becauÅ¿e we muÅ¿t be more in workes, then in words: and they are all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative: for it is againÅ¿t the nature of a worke,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16288:59"/> to be in the Negative: for Å¿o working Å¿hould be no better then idleneÅ¿Å¿e: the two former are generall, as generall as Good and Evill; that if we meet with any thing that is Evill, our part is to Depart: for there is no demurring upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; No dallying with baytes: leÅ¿t Å¿taying, we be Å¿tayed, as <hi>Eve</hi> was: Therefore <hi>depart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> If we meet with any thing that is good; our worke is, to fall a working; for vertue conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in action, and is not Å¿o proper to bee talked of, as to be done: we never reade of any reward for good words onely; but all reward is onely for good workes: <hi>BecauÅ¿e thou haÅ¿t done this;</hi> Å¿aith God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Therefore <hi>doe good.</hi> The two laÅ¿t Precepts are Å¿peciall; whither we call them Å¿peciall, as being particular, or as being excellent, for Å¿o is Peace: It is the legacie that was left us by ChriÅ¿t: and who would loÅ¿e ChriÅ¿ts Legacie, for want of Å¿eeking it? Therefore <hi>Å¿eeke Peace, and purÅ¿ue it:</hi> but not purÅ¿ue Peace, for this were to make warre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peace, but purÅ¿ue the Å¿eeking of Peace: for though it be Å¿aid; <hi>Å¿eeke, and yee Å¿hall find;</hi> yet it is not Å¿aid how long we muÅ¿t Å¿eeke before wee Å¿hall find: if therefore Å¿eeking Peace, you find it not at firÅ¿t, purÅ¿ue the Å¿eeking it, and you Å¿hall find it at laÅ¿t. Agree with thine AdverÅ¿arie while thou art in the way; This is to Å¿eeke peace: Leave thine offering at the Altar, and goe firÅ¿t, and be reconciled: This is to purÅ¿ue it, Or perhaps the counÅ¿ell that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16288:60"/> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> may expreÅ¿Å¿e it plainer: Be inÅ¿tant in Å¿eaÅ¿on, and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on: to bee inÅ¿tant in Å¿eaÅ¿on, is to Å¿eeke peace: to be inÅ¿tant out of Å¿eaÅ¿on, is to purÅ¿ue it. Indeed if a man deÅ¿ire long life, and to Å¿ee good dayes; he muÅ¿t have a Å¿peciall care of peace: whither it be peace in the humours, or peace in the PaÅ¿Å¿ions; whither Peace with God, or peace with men: they are all prolongers of life; and life is never Å¿hortened or diÅ¿quieted, but for want of peace in one of theÅ¿e, and therefore that you may not bee to Å¿eeke of long life; <hi>Å¿eeke peace, and purÅ¿ue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, is there not great cauÅ¿e, that the feare of the Lord Å¿hould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all our words and workes, when Å¿o great a MajeÅ¿tie, as the eye of God is looking upon them? when Å¿o Å¿acred an Auditorie, as the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>15</label> eares of God are hearkening to them? <hi>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his eares are open to their cry;</hi> and can any man be Å¿o without Å¿hame, as to bee without feare, when he is the Å¿pectacle which God is pleaÅ¿ed to looke upon? the Å¿peaker which he vouchÅ¿afes to hearken to? But, O my Å¿oule, as it cannot but make thee feare, Å¿o it cannot but make thee joy; for what greater honour, then to bee the object of Gods eyes and eares? What though the world regard thee not, as long as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards thee? What are the eyes and eares of the world, but eyes and eares of Å¿corne, or elÅ¿e of envie: of Å¿corne, when in adverÅ¿itie, and of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16288:60"/> envie in proÅ¿peritie? but the eyes of the Lord, are righteous eyes, and are therefore upon the righteous: his eares, are eares of compaÅ¿Å¿ion, and therefore are open to their cry. But are not the Eyes of the Lord, as well upon the wicked? and what priviledge then is this to the Righteous? No my Å¿oule, his Eyes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Righteous, but they are againÅ¿t the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and not onely his eyes, but his whole <hi>Face is againÅ¿t them, to cut off their remembrance <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>16</label> from the earth:</hi> O my Å¿oule, as thou conÅ¿idereÅ¿t with joy, the great force that is in righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, which drawes the eyes, and opens the eares of God: Å¿o conÅ¿ider with trembling, the great force that is in Å¿inne, which not onely turnes away his Eyes, and Å¿tops his Eares, but makes him to bend his whole Face in furie; that if his favours of looking upon us, and hearkening to us, cannot winne us to feare him out of love: at leaÅ¿t the bending his Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t us in anger, may force us to feare him out of terrour: for he bends not his Face to make a Å¿hew onely, as though he did but Å¿et a face upon it; but it is to cut off the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them that doe evill from the Earth.</p>
            <p>But may not the wicked erect Tombes and Monuments, that will preÅ¿erve their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for many Ages: perhaps as long as the Earth Å¿hall endure? and how then is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance cut off from the Earth? but from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16288:61"/> what Earth? is it not meant from the Land of the living? that in this may be Å¿eene the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent condition, betweene the godly and the wicked; for as it is Å¿aid here, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the wicked Å¿hall be cut off from the Earth; Å¿o it is Å¿aid in another place of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they Å¿hall be had in everlaÅ¿ting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: and where is any everlaÅ¿ting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to be had, but in the Land of the living? Indeed to have their remembrance cut off in this Earth, is not worthy of Gods threatning: It is the cutting off from the Land of the living, which is the blotting them out of the Booke of life; that is a worke worthy of Gods Å¿etting his Face againÅ¿t them, and this may well bee called a cutting off; not onely becauÅ¿e it Å¿hall come Å¿uddenly upon them, but becauÅ¿e they are never like to be heard; Alas! never like to be heard of any more, which can never be the condition of the godly, for they can never be Å¿o out of remembrance, but that they Å¿hall bee alwayes heard of God: <hi>For the righteous cry; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>17</label> and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is it like to be true, that the godly Å¿hall never be forgotten, when they Å¿eeme to be forgotten already while they live? for how elÅ¿e Å¿hould it happen, that they are more in trouble, in more trouble than other men, but that God hath caÅ¿t them out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? O my Å¿oule, their very being in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16288:61"/> is a certaine argument that God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them: if he had not remembred <hi>Job,</hi> and his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, he would never have given Sathan Å¿o much leave as he did to trouble him. For indeed, though troubles be judgements to the wicked; and are as the firÅ¿t blowes to cut off their remembrance from the earth, yet they are but tryals to the godly, and doe but Å¿erve to make their remembrance be the freÅ¿her. Doe we not Å¿ee how Trees are nipt with froÅ¿t and cold, and not Å¿o much as a leafe left hanging upon them, Å¿carce Å¿o much as life remaining in them? but is it not to renue in them the freÅ¿her Å¿pringing, and to make way for fruits in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie? and Å¿uch are the troubles of the godly, they end in deliverance; and though they be bitter for the preÅ¿ent, yet they make the joyes afterward to taÅ¿te the Å¿weeter. And what marvell, if God heare the cry of the righteous, being Å¿o nigh unto them as hee is? <hi>For the Lord is nigh unto them, that are of a broken <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>18</label> heart:</hi> Not broken with envie, as many are: Not broken with deÅ¿paire, as Å¿ome are; but broken with Å¿enÅ¿e of their Å¿inne, as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are; for this onely is the broken heart, to which God is nigh: and hee is not nigh it, in vaine: No my Å¿oule, it is good having God to be our neighbour; for hee Å¿aves all them to whom he is nigh; <hi>Hee Å¿aves all them that bee of a contrite, and humble heart:</hi> the lower they are in their owne eyes, the higher they are in his:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16288:62"/> and when their heart is broken with Å¿enÅ¿e of their Å¿inne, he makes it whole againe with Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>19</label> of his grace. It is true; <hi>Many are the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the righteous; but the Lord delivers them out of all.</hi> For the righteous have many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore muÅ¿t needes have many troubles; but their troubles are not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, becauÅ¿e they have the Lord for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; if it be Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, he makes their bed, in their Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e: If it be hunger, hee fills the hungrie with good things, when hee Å¿ends the rich emptie away: if it be Death it Å¿elfe; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Domini Å¿unt exitus mortis;</hi> the iÅ¿Å¿ues of Death are all in Gods hands: and all this while, though their heart be broken, yet their bones are whole Å¿till: They may have thornes in the fleÅ¿h, but <hi>not a bone of theirs is broken:</hi> for one of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>20</label> their bones is Faith, which though it may bee Å¿haken, yet it cannot bee broken: Another of their bones is Hope, which though it may bee battered, yet it cannot be broken: and Patience is a bone, which may be vexed, but can never be broken: for in all of them, the Lord hath a hand; Hee upholds the righteous, that they cannot fall: Hee Å¿trengthens them that they cannot faint, and as long as their bones bee whole, they are able to Å¿tand upright, and Å¿hrinke not for any burthen, that either the FleÅ¿h, or the World can lay upon them. And though <hi>David</hi> in this, have an eye perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ChriÅ¿t, of whom indeed there was not a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16288:62"/> Bone broken; yet what is Å¿poken of the Head, may not incongruouÅ¿ly bee applyed to the Members: and in the Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿ts bones, the bones of the godly are kept from breaking. But the troubles of the wicked are of another nature; for, <hi>Evill Å¿hall Å¿lay the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>21</label> and they that hate the righteous Å¿hall be deÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Their hearts perhaps are broken too, but becauÅ¿e they are not broken with Å¿enÅ¿e of their Å¿inne, but with Å¿pight and malice to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, there Å¿hall be none to make them whole, but their owne evill, Å¿hall be their owne deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and having none to deliver them, they Å¿hall be left deÅ¿olate, and without all hope of helpe. But Å¿hall not the wicked then have this good by being deÅ¿olate, that as they have none to helpe them, Å¿o they have none to hurt them? Alas! it needes not, they doe it faÅ¿t e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough themÅ¿elves; for Sinne is a recoyling PoyÅ¿on; it turnes violently backe upon them that commit it: and it may be truly Å¿aid of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man, that he is <hi>Felo de Å¿e,</hi> a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of himÅ¿elfe. Though RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of it Å¿elfe, doth not Å¿ave the Righteous, but they need a Saviour beÅ¿ides; yet wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of it Å¿elfe deÅ¿troyes the wicked, they need no other DeÅ¿troyer: <hi>Perditio tua ex te, O IÅ¿rael;</hi> Thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truÅ¿tion is from thy Å¿elfe, O IÅ¿rael.</p>
            <p>And, O my Å¿oule, what great Examples there are to verefie this Å¿aying; <hi>They that hate the righteous, Å¿hall be deÅ¿olate.</hi> When <hi>Cain</hi> hated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16288:63"/> the righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> was he not thereupon made deÅ¿olate, and became a Vagabond, forÅ¿aken both of God and man? but in a higher degree; when the wicked Jewes hated ChriÅ¿t the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, was there not a Voyce heard as of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Å¿aying; <hi>Migremus hinc:</hi> Let us depart from this place? and thereupon left them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olate, without Prince, or Prophet; without Temple, or Altar, to this day? You may Å¿ay perhaps, that <hi>Cain</hi> might eaÅ¿ily be made deÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, having killed his brother in a time, when there was no more in the whole world, but that one Familie: but how can the wicked bee made deÅ¿olate now, when <hi>Totus mundus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligno eÅ¿t poÅ¿itus;</hi> When all the world is full of them; and no BeaÅ¿ts Å¿o herd together as they doe? But is it not, that DeÅ¿olateneÅ¿Å¿e conÅ¿iÅ¿ts not Å¿o much in want of company, as in want of comfort: was <hi>Job</hi> the leÅ¿Å¿e deÅ¿olate for having company, of whom to Å¿ay; MiÅ¿erable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters are ye all? much leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hal the wicked be the leÅ¿Å¿e deÅ¿olate for having company of whom to Å¿ay; MiÅ¿erable Tormentours are yee all: for alas, all their companie, Å¿hall bee either Companions in their torments, or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions their tormentours: which can never bee the caÅ¿e of the godly: for though they be not Å¿o perfect, not to have their faults, yet they are Å¿o happy, not to have them imputed: for being Gods Å¿ervants, <hi>Hee will redeeme them:</hi> though they be taken captive, yet hee will not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16288:63"/> Å¿uffer them to continue Captives: but rather then not redeeme them, he will give his onely Sonne to be their ranÅ¿ome.</p>
            <p>But yet how can the godly chooÅ¿e but bee DeÅ¿olate, when the whole world Å¿carce affords enow to make a company? and where then can company be had to keepe them from being deÅ¿olate? O my Å¿oule, they have Angels to pitch their Tents about them, while they live here, and hereafter they Å¿hall come to bee Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in the <hi>New HieruÅ¿alem,</hi> where they Å¿hall have company enough: PrieÅ¿ts, and Patriarks; Prophets, and ApoÅ¿tles; Martyrs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ours; bleÅ¿Å¿ed Virgins, and chiefly the BleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed Virgin; but above all, where they Å¿hall Å¿ee the BleÅ¿Å¿ed face of God; whoÅ¿e onely Å¿ight is able; whoÅ¿e Å¿ight is onely able to keepe from being deÅ¿olate: and then at leaÅ¿t I Å¿hall bee as able to performe my Vow, as now I am ready to make it: I will bleÅ¿Å¿e the Lord at all times; his PraiÅ¿e Å¿hall continually be in my mouth.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16288:66"/> and for their Å¿afeguard: though they be Tabernacles of the Lord of HoÅ¿ts to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet they are Courts of the Prince of peace to the godly: and this makes <hi>my Å¿oule to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>2</label> long for the courts of the Lord.</hi> For I deÅ¿ire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be a Courtier, yet not as I am now; God knowes I am very unfit for it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e Gods Courts are Å¿uch, they make any one fit, that but comes into them: they receive not men fit, but make them fit; and he that was before, but a Å¿hrub in <hi>Baca;</hi> aÅ¿Å¿oone as hee comes into the Courts of the Lord, is preÅ¿ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Cedar in <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, if his Tabernacles bee Å¿o wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full amiable; they muÅ¿t needs be as wonderfull attractive, for there is no Å¿uch Adamant as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneÅ¿Å¿e: Nothing that Å¿o powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and drawes all hearts unto it. And to know the meaÅ¿ure of their AmiableneÅ¿Å¿e, by the power of their Attracting, you need but looke upon my Å¿oule: For, <hi>my Å¿oule longeth, and even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord:</hi> which it would never doe, if it were not for their wonderfull amiableneÅ¿Å¿e, that attracts, and drawes it by a kind of violence, indeed by a kind violence unto them.</p>
            <p>Every AmiableneÅ¿Å¿e is not Å¿o great to make a longing: Nor every longing Å¿o great, to make a fainting: Nor every fainting Å¿o great, to make the Å¿oule to faint: Oh then conÅ¿ider, how great this AmiableneÅ¿Å¿e is, which makes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16288:67"/> my Å¿oule not onely to long, but to faint with longing? And blame me not for fainting, as though it were my owne fault, that would not reÅ¿traine my longing: for Å¿eeing his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are of infinite amiableneÅ¿Å¿e, they muÅ¿t needs worke in me an infinite delighting; and that delighting, an infinite longing: and what reÅ¿traint can there be of that which is infinite? No alas, my fainting is but anÅ¿werable to my longing, and my longing but anÅ¿werable to the AmiableneÅ¿Å¿e: If I had the offer made me, which was made to ChriÅ¿t, to enjoy all the Kingdomes of the Earth, but with condition to want the Courts of the Lord; this want would bring to my Å¿oule a greater griefe, then that enjoying, would give it contentment: for Å¿eeing his Tabernacles are Å¿o amiable, where he is Lord of HoÅ¿ts; how amiable muÅ¿t they needs be, where hee is Prince of Peace? and Prince of Peace he is in his Courts, though in his Campe he be Lord of HoÅ¿ts.</p>
            <p>And that you may know it is not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of my Å¿oule, that it faints with longing: (for indeed weake Å¿pirits are apt to faint upon every light occaÅ¿ion) but that it is the very operation of the wonderfull attractive power, that is in the amiableneÅ¿Å¿e of his Courts: Å¿ee my Heart, and my FleÅ¿h alÅ¿o, how they are drawne to long after the Lord, which they would never doe, if it were not for Å¿ome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull amiableneÅ¿Å¿e that is in him: for you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16288:67"/> may well thinke, it muÅ¿t bee an Adamant of a wonderfull attractive power, that can draw theÅ¿e heavy I rons of my heart, and my fleÅ¿h unto it: for indeed, though my Soule have a longing for the Courts of the Lord, yet my Body perhaps could be content to want them; there are Courts in the world, that might pleaÅ¿e my Body as well; perhaps better then theÅ¿e, but God forbid: God forbid I Å¿hould be one, to have my Å¿oule and body divided while they are united, to have my Å¿oule runne one way, and my body another: No, I am none of thoÅ¿e; but aÅ¿Å¿oone as my Å¿oule longed for the Courts of the Lord; <hi>My heart, and my fleÅ¿h fell a longing for the living God:</hi> As my Soule lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the Place, Å¿o my heart, and my fleÅ¿h, for the PerÅ¿on: for my heart, and my fleÅ¿h, are of a duller apprehenÅ¿ion; they muÅ¿t have a preÅ¿ent Enjoying of that they long for, or they cannot be Å¿atisfied: but my Å¿oule is of a cleerer Å¿ight, and knows if it can but come to the place where he is, it Å¿hall be Å¿ure withall, to enjoy his preÅ¿ence, and with his preÅ¿ence, his PerÅ¿on. The Soule indeed is a Å¿pirituall Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is natural to the Å¿oule, to long after Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; but the fleÅ¿h is an earthly Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and therefore it is naturall to the fleÅ¿h, to long after earthly things: and as long as theÅ¿e two are linked in the Body together, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be working upon one another, alwayes Å¿eeking to draw each other to their partie: and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16288:68"/> if the Soule can draw the fleÅ¿h, to goe her Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall way, then all is well: it is as it Å¿hould be: but if the FleÅ¿h draw the Soule to goe her earthly way, then all is out of order; there will be no longing for the Courts of the Lord, for they are Å¿pirituall, and are never longed for, but where the Soule is predominant, and hath the leading. And this is the order in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> longing: firÅ¿t his Soule begins to long for the Courts of the Lord; and this is yet but a Å¿ingle cord: but then comes in, the Heart, and the FleÅ¿h too; and make it a Cord of three, that is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to bee broken. Indeed the Courts of the Lord are Å¿o exceeding amiable, that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible, but every Å¿oule muÅ¿t needs long after them: but yet every Å¿oule conÅ¿iders not what belongs to this longing: but as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> longed to dye the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet was loath to live the life of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; Å¿o there are many that long for the Courts of the Lord, but are loath to live the life of Å¿uch Courtiers. They that be in Kings houÅ¿es, weare Å¿ilke, and Å¿oft rayment, becauÅ¿e Å¿o it is fit for the honour of the place; and they that will be in the Courts of the Lord, muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e weare rayment, that is fit for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e of the place: they muÅ¿t be cloathed with the Å¿oft rayment of meekneÅ¿Å¿e, and humilitie; they muÅ¿t put on the robe of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and the garment of Sinceritie; or becauÅ¿e they are Courts of the Lord of HoÅ¿ts: their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16288:68"/> muÅ¿t rather be in Armour, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿eth it; they muÅ¿t take the Å¿hield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit; and if they come thus Cloathed, and thus Armed, they may juÅ¿tly then be Å¿aid, to long for the Courts of the Lord: but if they weare not theÅ¿e garmens, their longing will prove but a falÅ¿e conception, and they Å¿hall heare it Å¿aid: Friend, what makeÅ¿t thou here, without a Wedding garment?</p>
            <p>If my God were, as the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that have bodyes, but live not; that have eares, but heare not; my heart, and my fleÅ¿h, would then never cry after him, that could not heare them: but now that he is a living God, and hath eares to heare; how can they now forbeare to cry after him, that cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him? for alas, if hee Å¿hould leave them, what would become of them? what would my heart be, but as a dead corps; and what would my fleÅ¿h be, but as the Coffin?</p>
            <p>Thou affordeÅ¿t, O Lord, thy meaneÅ¿t crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <label type="milestone">

Alas! O Lord, if thou wilt not afford me thine Altars, for places of pleaÅ¿ure; at leaÅ¿t afford them to me for places of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that if I cannot make them a NeÅ¿t for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16288:69"/> my young ones; my humble Meditations, and my penitent Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ions; at leaÅ¿t I may offer upon them, the Å¿acrifices of Prayer, of praiÅ¿e, and ThankÅ¿-giving.</p>
            <p>I knew before by thy Courts, thou wert a King; and now I know by thine Altars, thou art a God; that confidently now I can Å¿ay; <hi>O Lord of HoÅ¿ts, my King, and my God:</hi> that if I feared thee before, as Lord of HoÅ¿ts; I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee more now as my King: and adore thee more yet as my God; which as they are to thee, the tender of my dutifulneÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o they are no leÅ¿Å¿e to me, the meanes of my bleÅ¿Å¿ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e: <label type="milestone">

               <hi>For bleÅ¿Å¿ed are they that dwell in thy houÅ¿e, they will Å¿till be praiÅ¿ing thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, how happens this? There were Tabernacles before, as belonging to a Lord; and Courts, as belonging to a King; and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, as belonging to a God: and now to be but a HouÅ¿e, as belonging to a private man? and Å¿o all this great RiÅ¿ing to end in a Fall? No, my Å¿oule, it is no Fall: it is an aggregation rather of all the other; for where his Tabernacles did but Å¿erve to Å¿hew his Power: his Courts but to Å¿hew his MajeÅ¿tie, his Altars, but to Å¿hew his Deitie; his HouÅ¿e Å¿erves to Å¿hew them all: for in his HouÅ¿e there will bee Å¿till prayÅ¿ing him: and his PraiÅ¿e and Glory is the Å¿umme of all. Or is it, that to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e, is a kind of appropriating him to our Å¿elves, Å¿eeing his Tabernacles, and his Courts, lye open to Å¿tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16288:69"/> his HouÅ¿e, open to none but his Å¿ervants: and Å¿eeing in the neereneÅ¿Å¿e to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ing with him, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts all true bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e; therefore, BleÅ¿Å¿ed are they that dwell in his HouÅ¿e. But how dwell in it? Not to looke in Å¿ometimes, as we paÅ¿Å¿e by; or to Å¿tay in it a time, as we doe at an Inne; but to be conÅ¿tant abiders in it day and night, as to which we have devoted our Å¿elves, and vowed our Å¿ervice.</p>
            <p>But it may be doubted, when <hi>David</hi> Å¿aith; <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed are they that dwell in Gods houÅ¿e:</hi> What Dwelling it is he meanes; whither dwelling in it, as Tenants, or as Å¿ervants? for if as Tenants, it is like there is Å¿ome Rent to be paid, and there is Å¿mall BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e in paying of Rent: It would be a more bleÅ¿Å¿ed thing, if they could dwell in his HouÅ¿e, and pay him no Rent. If as Å¿ervants, it is like there is Å¿ome worke to bee done, and there is Å¿mall bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: It would be a more bleÅ¿Å¿ed thing, if they could be his Å¿ervants, and doe no worke, and how then comes any BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e in, by dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his HouÅ¿e? Indeed take it either way, let them dwell in his HouÅ¿e as tenants, or as Å¿ervants, and they Å¿hall bee BleÅ¿Å¿ed: let them have Rent to pay, as Tenants; let them have worke to doe, as Å¿ervants, and yet they Å¿hall be bleÅ¿Å¿ed: and that which may Å¿eeme moÅ¿t Å¿trange, the Rent, and the Worke which Å¿eeme to hinder their bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, is the very thing that makes them be bleÅ¿Å¿ed: for they are both
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16288:70"/> but one thing, both but praiÅ¿ing of God; and praiÅ¿ing of God is the onely thing, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Tenants, or Servants; whether Bond, or Free, will make them be BleÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a Dwelling that hath not yet beene thought of; a Dwelling indeed that makes the true BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e: and it is, to dwell in Gods houÅ¿e, neither as Tenants, nor yet as Å¿ervants, but as Å¿onnes: for neither Tenants nor Servants, abide in the houÅ¿e for ever, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sonne abideth for ever: and therefore though the HouÅ¿e of God Å¿eeme a meaner Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then his Tabernacles, and his Courts; yet to us, it is the more comfortable title, Å¿eeing it makes us to be Å¿onnes, which neither his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, nor his Courts can doe.</p>
            <p>But how appeares it to bee true, that they who dwell in Gods houÅ¿e, wil alwayes be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing him? Å¿eeing it is but Å¿eldome Å¿eene, that Å¿ervants be Å¿o forward to praiÅ¿e their MaÅ¿ters? O my Å¿oule, it is not Å¿o much the good diÅ¿poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Å¿ervants; as the infinite worthineÅ¿Å¿e of the MaÅ¿ter, that makes them to praiÅ¿e him: for when they Å¿ee the admirable O economie of his Government, when they Å¿ee how Å¿weetly he diÅ¿poÅ¿eth all things in weight and meaÅ¿ure, when they find him to uÅ¿e them more like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then Å¿ervants; what heart can bee Å¿o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as not to praiÅ¿e him? and Å¿eeing by dwelling in Gods HouÅ¿e, they Å¿ee theÅ¿e things continually; therefore they that dwell in his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16288:70"/> HouÅ¿e, will alwayes bee praiÅ¿ing him.</p>
            <p>But is it not a Å¿trange reaÅ¿on of BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, to Å¿ay they are bleÅ¿Å¿ed, becauÅ¿e they are Å¿till praiÅ¿ing him? to be praiÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves, might perhaps be Å¿ome bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e: but what bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e can it be to praiÅ¿e another? Indeed if that other, were but Å¿uch another as our Å¿elves, it could be none: but when that other is Å¿uch, as that there is not Å¿uch another, or rather not another at all, to praiÅ¿e Å¿uch a one, certainly muÅ¿t needs bee bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, or there can bee none; and Å¿uch a one is God: for alas what are we, but that in him wee live, and move, and have our Being: Hee onely is All in All. O my Å¿oule, if it were not for praiÅ¿ing of God, there had never beene Created Å¿uch a thing as PrayÅ¿e: at leaÅ¿t we may juÅ¿tly Å¿ay, that God, and PrayÅ¿e, are as truly Relatives, as any that are found in either Art, or Nature.</p>
            <p>You may Å¿ay then, It is like to bee an eaÅ¿ie matter to be BleÅ¿Å¿ed, if there goe no more to BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, but prayÅ¿ing of God. Marke therefore how <hi>David</hi> Å¿peakes; <hi>They will be Å¿till prayÅ¿ing him.</hi> It is not enough to praiÅ¿e him; it muÅ¿t bee a praiÅ¿ing him Å¿till, before it will make a BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, and though to praiÅ¿e God be an eaÅ¿ie matter; yet to praiÅ¿e him Å¿till, will be found a buÅ¿ie worke; indeed to fleÅ¿h and bloud a miÅ¿erable worke; for if I be Å¿till prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing him, what time Å¿hall I have for any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure? O my Å¿oule, if thou make it not thy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16288:71"/> pleaÅ¿ure, thy chiefe, thy onely pleaÅ¿ure to bee prayÅ¿ing him; thou art not like in haÅ¿t to come to BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e. And marvell not that <hi>David</hi> Å¿peakes thus under the Law; When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> under the GoÅ¿pell Å¿aith as much: <hi>Whether ye eat, or drinke, or whatÅ¿oever yee doe elÅ¿e; let all be done to the glory, and praiÅ¿e of God.</hi> And indeed, how can I doubt of attaining to BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e by praiÅ¿ing of God; when it is praiÅ¿ing of God; that makes the Angels in heaven BleÅ¿Å¿ed? for the Å¿eeing of God, would never make them bleÅ¿Å¿ed, if Å¿eeing him, they did not praiÅ¿e him: and praiÅ¿ing him would never make them bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, if they did not praiÅ¿e him continually; crying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: for as we praiÅ¿e God here on Earth, with Å¿aying, O Lord God of HoÅ¿ts; becauÅ¿e here, he fighteth for us againÅ¿t our enemies; Å¿o wee Å¿hall praiÅ¿e him in heaven with Å¿aying, O Lord God of Sabbath, becauÅ¿e there he will give us reÅ¿t from our enemies.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16288:71"/> When we truÅ¿t to our owne Å¿trength for BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, we are often deceived, indeed as often as alwayes; but when our Å¿trength is in God, we may reÅ¿t Å¿ecure; our bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e is upon a Rocke, and cannot be Å¿haken. But then Gods wayes muÅ¿t be in our hearts: for what way hath his Å¿trength to the heart, if his wayes be not in the heart: That's their place, if wee looke for Å¿trength from him. Are we not in a continuall fight againÅ¿t Sin; and have we any Å¿trength to fight, but onely in him? and will he take it well to be placed in a Wing? No my Å¿oule, he will Å¿trengthen us no longer then hee is placed in the heart of the Battell: That's his place, if wee looke to bee Å¿trengthened in him.</p>
            <p>It is not enough that Gods wayes bee knowne, if they be not walked in; nor walked in, if not embraced: and it is not enough to embrace them with the armes, which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feigned, and but onely complimentall; they muÅ¿t be embraced, with the two armes of the heart; Integritie, and Sinceritie: Integritie will embrace them all; Sinceritie will embrace no other. Though Gods wayes be many, yet they muÅ¿t all goe into one Heart; if any be left out, the reÅ¿t will not tarry; though they muÅ¿t be in Å¿ingleneÅ¿Å¿e of heart, yet they muÅ¿t not be Å¿ingle in the heart; They are fruites that grow in cluÅ¿ters, not one by one.</p>
            <p>There are many that have Gods wayes in

            <p>But it Å¿hould Å¿eeme that this Prayer belongs onely to <hi>David,</hi> or at leaÅ¿t to Kings, who like <hi>David</hi> are the Lords anoynted, and what is it then to us that are private perÅ¿ons? It is true indeed, that Kings are the Lords anoynted in a Å¿peciall manner: but yet every child of God is his anoynted too; for why elÅ¿e is it Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, that he was anoynted with the oyle of gladneÅ¿Å¿e, above his fellowes; if it bee not that his fellowes, meaning the children of God, be anoynted too? Anoynted no doubt with the oyle of Grace; but to bee anoynted with the oyle of gladneÅ¿Å¿e, is the very thing I pray for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16288:73"/> here: the very thing, that makes mee long Å¿o much for the Courts of the Lord: <hi>For one day <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>10</label> in his courts, is better then a thouÅ¿and:</hi> It is not Å¿o much the length of time, as the meaÅ¿ure of joy that makes the bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e: Or is it, that one day which Å¿hall never end; as the day is in Gods Courts, is better than a thouÅ¿and which have an end, as all the dayes of this world are. If he had Å¿aid, one day in his Courts, is as good as a thouÅ¿and; though this had beene a mighty odds, yet it had bin but a thouÅ¿and to one, there had at leaÅ¿t beene Å¿ome proportion: but when he Å¿aith; One day in his Courts, is beter than a thouÅ¿and; this Å¿eemes to exceed all poÅ¿Å¿ibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of compariÅ¿on, and leaves no place for any proportion. Indeed one day in his Courts, gives Å¿eiÅ¿in of Eternitie, where a ThouÅ¿and that are Å¿pent any where elÅ¿e, are but Å¿teps of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. If I be but one day in his Courts, I Å¿hall Å¿ee that which will bee a joy unto mee, all the dayes of my life: where if I be a thouÅ¿and in any other Courts; I Å¿hall Å¿ee nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and vexation of Å¿pirit, that which will grieve me to thinke of, as often as I remember it. And as it is true in reÅ¿pect of Time; Å¿o it is no leÅ¿Å¿e true in reÅ¿pect of Place: For, <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a doore-keeper in the houÅ¿e of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> But is it Å¿uch a diÅ¿paragement to be a Doore-keeper? What was the Angell with the flaming Sword, but the Doore-keeper of ParadiÅ¿e? and is there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16288:74"/> not a conceit, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is the Doore-keeper of Heaven? Which though it be a vaine conceit, yet it may leade us to this congruous interpretation of <hi>Davids</hi> Å¿peech, to conceive as if he Å¿aid, that hee had rather be Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the houÅ¿e of God, then be <hi>Annas,</hi> or <hi>Caiphas,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Herod.</hi> Indeed in the Å¿ence that ChriÅ¿t is a Doore; <hi>David</hi> may well bee content to be a Doore-keeper: and though in Gods HouÅ¿e, there bee many ManÅ¿ions; yet Å¿eeing all of them are glorious, even the Doore-keepers place is not without its glory. But if you thinke the Office to be meane: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider then whoÅ¿e Officer hee is: for even a Doore-keeper is an officer in Gods houÅ¿e; and God never diÅ¿placeth his Officers, unleÅ¿Å¿e it be to advance them to a higher: Where in the Courts of Princes, the greateÅ¿t Officers are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times diÅ¿placed; turn'd off often with diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. However it be, it Å¿hewes not onely the great glory of Gods HouÅ¿e, but the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of <hi>Davids</hi> heart; and that he is not of the ambitious humour of the Mother of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> Å¿onnes, whom no place would Å¿erve for her Å¿onnes, but to have one of them Å¿it at his Right hand, the other at his left. O gracious God, grant me but a Doore-keepers place in thy houÅ¿e, and I will never aÅ¿pire after any higher roome: Not that I deÅ¿ire, to let in, and keepe out whom I pleaÅ¿e, but that I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have liberty to walke in thy houÅ¿e, and to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16288:74"/> enjoy thy PreÅ¿ence, in whoÅ¿e preÅ¿ence is the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of Joy for evermore. What are the Tents of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, but like Caves that have no light, and like Vineyards that have no Fences? and is there any compariÅ¿on to bee made betweene Å¿uch Tents; and the meaneÅ¿t place in the HouÅ¿e of God, where God not onely affordeth Light, but is HimÅ¿elfe the Light; Not onely is a Defendour, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it Å¿elfe? <hi>For the Lord is a Sunne and Å¿hield; the Lord will give grace and glory.</hi> I had heard <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>11</label> before, that <hi>In Å¿ole poÅ¿uit Tabernaculum Å¿uum:</hi> God hath placed his Tabernacle in the Sunne; But I never knew he was himÅ¿elfe a Sunne till now: but what Sunne? Not the Sunne that is but the child of light, but the Sunne who is the Father of Lights: Not the Sunne that was not, till three dayes after it was light; but the Sunne that was before ever any light was made; Not the Sunne which the Heathen commit Idolatrie in worÅ¿hipping; but the Sunne whom it is Idolatrie not to worÅ¿hip. Oh that the Heathen would all worÅ¿hip this Sunne: it Å¿hould not then be Å¿aid; <hi>Plures adorant Solem orientem, quam occidentem:</hi> That more worÅ¿hip the Sunne riÅ¿ing, then Å¿etting: for this Sunne once RiÅ¿en, never Å¿ets againe; once Å¿hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is never any more EcclipÅ¿ed. Oh then vouchÅ¿afe, O God, if thou be a Sunne, to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my darkneÅ¿Å¿e; if a Å¿hield, to protect my weakneÅ¿Å¿e: if thou bee a Sunne, warme my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16288:75"/> Å¿oule with the beames of Devotion; if a Å¿hield, defend my Å¿oule from the blowes of Temptation: if thou be a Sunne, O Å¿hine upon me, with the light of thy Countenance; if a Shield, O Å¿tand betweene me, and the aÅ¿Å¿aults of Sathan; for alas, O Lord, I am darkneÅ¿Å¿e, and weakneÅ¿Å¿e, the Anvile of temptations, the very Butt of Sathan, if thou bee not a Sunne, and a Shield unto mee. O my Å¿oule, God will doe more then this; <hi>Hee will give grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Grace to be a Shield unto us, and Glory to be a Sunne unto us; Hee will give Grace to prevent us, and Glory to follow us: Grace, to walke uprightly; and Glory, if walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly: Grace for a foundation to Glory, and Glory for a Crowne to Grace: and if theÅ¿e things bee not enough, hee will doe more yet: Doe thou but walke uprightly, and what good things Å¿oever there are in Gods gift, they Å¿hall all be given thee: for <hi>No good thing will God with-hold from them that live uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is this true, when God often-times with-holds Riches, and Honours, and health of body from men, though they walke never Å¿o uprightly? We may therefore know, that honours, and riches, and bodily Å¿trength, are none of Gods good things: they are of the number of things indifferent, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towes promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly upon the juÅ¿t, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿t, as the raine to fall, and the Sunne to Å¿hine: The good things of God, are chiefly Peace of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16288:75"/> conÅ¿cience, and joy in the Holy GhoÅ¿t, in this life; Fruition of Gods PreÅ¿ence, and ViÅ¿ion of his bleÅ¿Å¿ed Face, in the next: and theÅ¿e good things God never beÅ¿towes upon the wicked, never with-holds from the godly; and are all caÅ¿t up in one Å¿umme, where it is Å¿aid, <hi>Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipÅ¿i videbunt Deum:</hi> BleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed are the pure of Heart, (and Å¿uch are onely they that walke uprightly) for they Å¿hall Å¿ee God. But is walking uprightly Å¿uch a matter with God, that it Å¿hould be Å¿o rewarded? Is it not more pleaÅ¿ing to God to Å¿ee us goe Å¿too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then walking upright; Å¿eeing Å¿tooping is the gate of Humilitie; then which, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God more pleaÅ¿ing? It is no doubt a hard matter, to Å¿toope, and goe upright, both at once; yet both muÅ¿t be done, and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are done, are done at once by every one that is godly; but when I Å¿ay, they are done both at once, I meane not of the body: I know two Å¿uch poÅ¿tures in the Body both at once, are impoÅ¿Å¿ible: but the Soule can doe it, the Soule can Å¿toope, and goe upright, both at once; for then doth the Soule walke upright before God, when it Å¿toopes in humilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men.</p>
            <p>And what remaines now for <hi>David</hi> to doe, but to bring in the concluÅ¿ion upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿es, Å¿eeing the Lord of HoÅ¿ts, though his Name be dreadfull, yet his Nature is lovely, Å¿eeing he is a Sunne to cheriÅ¿h, and a Shield to

            <p>And what remaines now for us to doe, but to receive this ConcluÅ¿ion of <hi>David,</hi> as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olute DemonÅ¿tration: and thereupon to walke uprightly, and to put our whole truÅ¿t and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, through the merits of his Son ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us; for then we are Å¿ure, wee are in a Å¿ure way, of attaining to BleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e, to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e: that after this, we may leave our wondring, yet continue our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; <hi>How amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, O Lord God of HoÅ¿ts!</hi>

And yet perhaps, to forgive all my Å¿innes, not a greater benefit, then to heale all my infirmities; (This being the chiefe worke of his Grace, as that of his Mercy) for Å¿eeing my Å¿innes, many of them, and upon the matter, all of them, bee Å¿innes of infirmitie: (for even wilfulneÅ¿Å¿e, and preÅ¿umption, are of infirmitie) by healing my infirmities, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents me of Å¿inning: and is it not, as great a benefit, to keepe me from committing Å¿innes, as to forgiue my Å¿innes, when I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them? But, O my Å¿oule, meddle not with this high point of Heraldrie, to diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e, which is the greater of Gods Mercy, or his Grace: They are both an AbyÅ¿Å¿us: it is worke enough for thee, and for all that is within me, to BleÅ¿Å¿e him for both: and for both indeed thou haÅ¿t juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to BleÅ¿Å¿e him, Å¿eeing it is by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of both, that thou art able to BleÅ¿Å¿e him.

For, O my Å¿oule, conÅ¿ider the multitude of infirmities, to which thou art Å¿ubject; thou haÅ¿t many Å¿uggeÅ¿tions of the fleÅ¿h: and thou art apt to conÅ¿ent, and yeeld unto them, and Å¿triveÅ¿t not againÅ¿t them by earneÅ¿t Prayer, and holy Meditations; This is an infirmitie.

In thy Hearing; Thou art gladder to heare prophane, and idle diÅ¿courÅ¿es, then Å¿uch as be Å¿erious, and holy: TheÅ¿e are infirmities: and, O my Å¿oule, if I Å¿hould cut thee up into as many parts, as an AnatomiÅ¿t, and examine the infirmities of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part; Å¿hould I not have cauÅ¿e, juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to cry out with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> O wretch that I am, who Å¿hall deliver me from this body of Å¿inne?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16288:81"/> Who Å¿hall heale me of all theÅ¿e infirmities? for whether we call them Å¿innes, and then God forgives them; or call them Infirmities, and then he heales them: they are to us, all one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; in God, all one kindneÅ¿Å¿e; that as either of them is well worth remembring; Å¿o for both of them, we have juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to bleÅ¿Å¿e him, and to praiÅ¿e his Name.</p>
            <p>But, O my Å¿oule, as thou remembreÅ¿t theÅ¿e things; that both he forgiveth all thy Å¿ins, and healeth all thy infirmities: Å¿o remember alÅ¿o their conÅ¿equences too; for upon theÅ¿e, there are great matters depending, as worthy to bee remembred, as the things themÅ¿elves. For alas my Å¿oule, thou wert by Å¿inne come to be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and the Å¿entence of <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> was paÅ¿t upon thee: but now, by forgiving thy Å¿innes, this Å¿entence is reverÅ¿ed: by healing thy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, thy life is Redeemed; it is taken out of the hands of the DeÅ¿troyer, and put into the hands of a Redeemer; and a Redeemer not onely from Captivitie, but from deÅ¿truction: for Captivitie takes away but onely thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but deÅ¿truction would take away thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Being: and can it be thou Å¿houldÅ¿t not keepe that in memorie, which is it Å¿elfe the cauÅ¿e, that thou haÅ¿t a Memorie? for what memorie couldÅ¿t thou have, if thou hadÅ¿t not a Being? and what Being couldÅ¿t thou have, if thou wert deÅ¿troyed? and deÅ¿troyed thou Å¿houldÅ¿t be, if thou wert not Redeemed; and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16288:81"/> thou canÅ¿t not be, unleÅ¿Å¿e thy Å¿innes bee forgiven. This no doubt, is a conÅ¿equence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten; and yet perhaps there is a conÅ¿equence behind, of greater conÅ¿equence then this: For this (my Å¿oule) gives thy life but onely a duration; but there is a conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a comming, that will give it an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, <hi>he crownes thee with loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, and with tender mercies.</hi> To be madk a King, is an eminent favour: but to be made a King from being a Captive, where not onely the <hi>Quo</hi> is Å¿o conÅ¿iderable, but the <hi>Unde</hi> more; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Å¿upereminent favour, and hardly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of expreÅ¿Å¿ing. And this is thy caÅ¿e, for where before thou hadÅ¿t fetters upon thy feet, thou haÅ¿t now a Crowne upon thy head: and not a Crowne gotten by violence, and worne with feare: but <hi>He crownes thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and tender mercies.</hi> His kindneÅ¿Å¿e would have made a Crowne good enough for thy wearing; but his loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, makes it a Crowne worthy of his giving. And if there be doubt, that his mercies alone may not bee ready enough, to beÅ¿tow this Crowne upon thee; yet of the readineÅ¿Å¿e of his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, there can be no doubt: there can indeed be no doubt, Å¿eeing his loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, and his tender mercies, are the Crowne it Å¿elfe, which he beÅ¿towes. For, O my Å¿oule, when I Å¿peake of a Crowne, thou muÅ¿t not fancie to thy Å¿elfe, Å¿uch a Crowne as Kings of the earth weare:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16288:82"/> For ChriÅ¿t profeÅ¿Å¿ed plainly, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muÅ¿t thine be: but conÅ¿ider the extent of Gods loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, and of his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and thou wilt find a better Crowne laid up for thee; then all the Kingdomes of the Earth put together, can afford. O gracious God, grant me the Crowne of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and tender mercies; and all other Crownes I willingly lay downe at the foot of thy Throne, with the foure and twentie Elders: This onely is the Crowne to which my Å¿oule aÅ¿pires, for onely this Crowne makes Å¿inne, and Death to be my Å¿ubjects; Rebellious Å¿inne, that can never be brought into Å¿ubjection, but onely by this Crowne, O God, of thy loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e, and tender mercies. TheÅ¿e indeed are ConÅ¿equences moÅ¿t worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but yet perhaps not apt to be remembred, for are they not of too high a Å¿traine? and what the underÅ¿tanding doth not well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, the memorie doth not eaÅ¿ily retaine: He will therefore deÅ¿cend to Benefits of a lower <label type="milestone">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16288:82"/> all but for the mouth: Å¿o long as we may have greene PaÅ¿tures, and Å¿till Waters; Å¿o long as we may have meat and drinkes, not onely to Å¿atisfie hunger, but to pleaÅ¿e the palate, wee care not greatly for any thing elÅ¿e. But, O my Å¿oule, theÅ¿e are not the good things that are here meant; and yet even this perhaps were worth the caring for, if it might continue: but alas, the dayes will come, when I Å¿hall Å¿ay, I have no pleaÅ¿ure in them: the time will come, when my mouth will loÅ¿e its taÅ¿te; and what good then will theÅ¿e good things of the mouth doe me? No, my Å¿oule, no feare here of old age; no feare of defect by reaÅ¿on of yeares: For, <hi>thy youth Å¿hall bee renewed like the Eagles;</hi> There Å¿hall be no looÅ¿ening here of the Å¿ilver Cord, no breaking of the golden Bowle; but as the Eagle by mewing her feathers, renues her youth: So thou (my Å¿oule) by mewing thy feathers, which is by caÅ¿ting off this fraile Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of thy fleÅ¿h, Å¿halt perpetually be kept by the powerfull hand of God, in a Å¿tate of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Indeed the life we live now, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t part no life; for Child-hood is Å¿carce come to it, and Old age is almoÅ¿t paÅ¿t it; no time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly remaining to life, but onely the Å¿hort time of youth: but the life that God hath in Å¿tore for them that feare him; not onely Å¿hall be alwayes, but Å¿hall be alwayes Youth, and no defect of Age Å¿hall be able to take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:16288:83"/>
            <p>But may we not now begin anew, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive rather, that when <hi>David</hi> calls upon his Å¿oule to bleÅ¿Å¿e the Lord; <hi>and not to forget all his benefits:</hi> Hee meanes, he would have it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all his benefits; and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently falls to reckon them all up himÅ¿elfe; not <hi>Å¿ingula generum,</hi> but <hi>genera Å¿ingulorum;</hi> Not all in particular, but the generall Heads, under which, all the Particulars are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And he begins <hi>with forgiving of Å¿innes,</hi> becauÅ¿e this is the Foundation, this is that which reconciles us to God, and which makes us capable of all his other benefits. But alas, what good will his forgiving my Å¿innes doe me, if he Å¿tay there, and goe no further? for Å¿hall I not be committing of new Å¿innes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and Å¿o God Å¿hall bee alwayes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and never the neere? Never the neere, unleÅ¿Å¿e hee be alwayes forgiving. To helpe this therefore, his next benefit, is the healing all my infirmities: for this takes away that aptneÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿inne, to which wee are all of us by nature Å¿o prone and Å¿ubject. But alas, what good will both theÅ¿e benefits doe me, if hee yet Å¿tay here, and goe no further? Å¿eeing I am now a captive, and already condemned to dye the death? for Å¿hould not my caÅ¿e bee like to theirs, who upon the Å¿caffold aske the King forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e, and when he forgives them, yet they are put to death nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e. His next <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>4</label> benefit therefore is a remedie for this: <hi>For hee

But alas, what good yet will all theÅ¿e doe me, if he Å¿hould yet Å¿tay here, and goe no further? for when my Å¿innes be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; when my infirmities healed; when my life redeemed; yet what am I more by all this, then as it were an <hi>AbraÅ¿a tabula</hi> at moÅ¿t, what have I more to take joy in, then every other ordinary creature?

            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, let not my being in trouble, and oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with Å¿orrowes; make thee doubt of the truth of theÅ¿e things; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides <label type="milestone">

And this RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and this Judgement, he not onely deliberateth, and determineth; hee not onely promiÅ¿eth to the godly, and threatens to the wicked, and then leaves them undone: but he is perfect in all his wayes; hee is truly Reall, and puts them moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿uredly in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at leaÅ¿t, he executes them <hi>Per Å¿e,</hi> or <hi>Per ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> either by himÅ¿elfe, or by his Angels: For indeed this part of his Judgement, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniÅ¿hment, is not properly in God <hi>Opus Å¿uum:</hi> and therefore no marvell if hee leave it, to be done by Angels, as he did at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> but though the MiniÅ¿trie be theirs, yet the Execution is His: all the power is onely from him.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16288:85"/> any Å¿lowneÅ¿Å¿e is in God, but his Å¿lowneÅ¿Å¿e is his Patience, and his Patience is out of compaÅ¿Å¿ion: for alas, if God were as ready to anger, as we are ready to provoke him to anger we had long ere this, been turned to duÅ¿t, and utterly conÅ¿umed.</p>
            <p>O my Å¿oule, here are foure properties Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to be in God; and are all Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that we could not miÅ¿Å¿e one of them. If hee were not mercifull, we could hope for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and if he were no more but mercifull, we could hope for no more but pardon; but when beÅ¿ides his being mercifull, he is alÅ¿o gracious; this gives us a further hope, a hope of a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and then it will not be, what we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive, but what it is fit for him to give. If he were not Å¿low to anger, we could expect no patience; and if he were but onely Å¿low to anger, we could expect no more but patience; but when beÅ¿ides his Å¿lowneÅ¿Å¿e to anger, hee is alÅ¿o full of compaÅ¿Å¿ion; This makes us expect, he will be the good Samaritane, and not onely bind up our wounds, but take care alÅ¿o for our further curing. What though he chide, and be angry for a time: It is but our being patient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while with him, as he a long time hath beene <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>9</label> patient with us: <hi>For he will not bee alwayes chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; neither will hee keepe his anger for ever:</hi> No my Å¿oule, conÅ¿ider the rule of Nature; that <hi>Nullum violentum eÅ¿t diuturnum:</hi> and you will find it true in the God of Nature: Mercy, and CompaÅ¿Å¿ion, are kindly, and naturall in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16288:85"/> God, and therefore theÅ¿e will continue, and never leave him: but chiding, and anger, are things, I may Å¿ay, violent, and not naturall in him; and therefore it cannot bee that theÅ¿e Å¿hould laÅ¿t, or continue long with him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as unpleaÅ¿ing to God to chide, as it is to us to be chidden; and Å¿o little hee likes of Anger, that he riddes his hands of it as faÅ¿t as he can: he is not Å¿o Å¿low in comming to it, but he is as quick in getting from it: for chiding is a barre to Mercy, and Anger an impediment to CompaÅ¿Å¿ion: and nothing is Å¿o diÅ¿taÅ¿tfull to God, as that any block Å¿hould lye in the way of his Mercy, or that the libertie of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿hould have any cauÅ¿e of reÅ¿traint: and then we may be Å¿ure, hee will not himÅ¿elfe lay a block in the way with chiding, nor be a cauÅ¿e to reÅ¿traine his CompaÅ¿Å¿ion, by keeping his Anger. And we may the better be perÅ¿waded of this, in that which is to come, by taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that which is paÅ¿t: For, <hi>Hee hath not dealt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>10</label> with us, after our Å¿innes; neither rewarded us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our iniquities.</hi> Though he have chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yet hee hath not Å¿trucken: or if hee have Å¿trucken, yet his blowes have not beene great, not Å¿o great to doe us any hurt, for there is mercy in his very Anger; and though we keep our Å¿elves within no bounds of Å¿inning, yet he keepes his Anger within the bounds of Mercy. Alas! O Lord, if thou Å¿houldÅ¿t deale with me after my Å¿innes; as I have uÅ¿ed no meaÅ¿ure in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16288:86"/> my Å¿inning; Å¿o thou Å¿houldÅ¿t uÅ¿e no meaÅ¿ure in my puniÅ¿hing, and what then could I expect to befall me, but utterly to periÅ¿h?</p>
            <p>But why is it that God hath not dealt with us after our Å¿innes? Is it not becauÅ¿e hee hath dealt with another after our Å¿innes? Another who tooke our Å¿innes upon him: of whom it is Å¿aid, that God <hi>chaÅ¿tened him in his fierce wrath:</hi> and why did he chaÅ¿ten him, but for our Å¿innes? O gracious God, Thou art too juÅ¿t to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge twice for the Å¿ame faults: and therefore having turned thy fierce wrath upon him, Thou wilt not turne it upon us too: but having rewarded him according to our iniquities, thou wilt now reward us according to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. O Deere JeÅ¿us, let not thy painfull Å¿uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings bee made fruÅ¿trate by my Å¿infull doings: but Å¿o mediate betweene God and my Å¿innes, that hee may turne away his angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from me, and looke upon me onely with the eye of his Mercy. And, O my Å¿oule, how canÅ¿t thou doubt of this, when <hi>As high as the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>11</label> Heaven is above the Earth; Å¿o great is his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that feare him:</hi> and who would wiÅ¿h for a greater mercy to bee in God, then this? But yet the diÅ¿tance betweene Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though great, and indeed very admirable great, is but a limited diÅ¿tance: and is there then a limitation, and a boundary of Gods mercy? May I not as truly Å¿ay, as low as Hell, is beneath the Earth; Å¿o great is my Å¿inne in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16288:86"/> the Å¿ight of God? and how then am I Å¿ure, that Gods mercy is any greater then my Å¿ins? and if not greater, how can it pardon them? O my Å¿oule, though the heighth of Heaven be limited, yet Gods mercy hath no limitation, for his Mercy is above all his Workes, and therefore above Heaven the worke of his hands. Or if hee Å¿eeme to Å¿et a limitation to Gods mercy, is it not perhaps, becauÅ¿e there is Å¿ome Å¿inne that is not capable of his Mercy? for Å¿inne againÅ¿t the Holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿hall never be forgiven, either in this world, or in the world to come. But, O my Å¿oule, though Gods mercy bee without limitation, yet let it not make thee the bolder to Å¿inne: for though it be Å¿o great, yet it is Å¿o great to none, but to them that feare him: for to them that feare him not, it is not Å¿o great; Alas! it is not great at all: Alas! it will be none at all; but if thou feare him, and to feare him, is to feare to Å¿inne: then thy Å¿inne can never be Å¿o great, but that Gods mercy, which is as high as Heaven, will bring thee to bee admitted into the kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But if you thinke this diÅ¿tance of height, from Earth to Heaven, not Å¿ufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods mercy; then take the diÅ¿tance of length, from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t: <hi>For as farre as the EaÅ¿t is from the WeÅ¿t; Å¿o farre <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>12</label> hath he removed our Å¿innes from us:</hi> that if the EaÅ¿t, and the WeÅ¿t, can never come to meet
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16288:87"/> together; no more Å¿hall our Å¿innes bee ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come againÅ¿t us in the Å¿ight of God. But alas, this gives not Å¿o good Å¿atisfaction as the other: for though the diÅ¿tance from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t, bee vaÅ¿t indeed to us; as to which our Å¿ight cannot reach, though wee Å¿hould uÅ¿e all the PerÅ¿pective glaÅ¿Å¿es of the world: yet what is this to God, who can as eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t, as if they were hard by, and cloÅ¿e to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? But is it not that all Gods mercy to us, is onely in ChriÅ¿t: and may wee not then conceive, that theÅ¿e DiÅ¿tances are repreÅ¿ented by the manner of ChriÅ¿ts hanging upon the CroÅ¿Å¿e; where his Feet, and his Head, Å¿eeme to point from Earth to Heaven; and the Å¿tretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hands, Å¿eemes to point from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t? But though Relation to ChriÅ¿t be not the ground of theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions; yet it cannot be doubted, but that they Å¿ufficiently expreÅ¿Å¿e the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods mercy; Å¿eeing they are the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿tances, that humane apprehenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is capable to conceive.</p>
            <p>But if you bee not Å¿atisfied with theÅ¿e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ings from DiÅ¿tances of place; then take an expreÅ¿Å¿ing from the affection of Nature: <label type="milestone">

            <p>But though there may be compariÅ¿on in the tenderneÅ¿Å¿e of their pitties, yet in the abilitie there can bee none; for a Father pitties often-times a child, when he cannot helpe him: but Gods pitty, is alwayes active and powerfull, and never without releeving: that though it be commonly Å¿aid; <hi>It is better to be envied, then pittied:</hi> yet here it is not Å¿o: but it is a farre happier thing, to be pittied of God, then to be envied of men.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16288:88"/>
            <p>But whom is it that God pitties? onely them that feare him; and indeed Feare is a thing that deÅ¿erves to be pittied: for it makes the joynts to tremble, and puts the Å¿pirits in amazement. But O my Å¿oule, it is not Å¿uch a Feare that is here meant; but this Feare is all one, I may Å¿ay with love, and differs but in the Object: for looking upon Gods JuÅ¿tice wee feare him: and looking upon his Mercy wee love him: although wee love him for his JuÅ¿tice too, and wee feare him for his Mercie too: for as there is Mercie with him, that hee may be feared; Å¿o there is JuÅ¿tice with him that he may be loved.</p>
            <p>But why is it, that God pitties them that feare him? Indeed hee hath cauÅ¿e enough to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>14</label> pittie them: <hi>For hee conÅ¿iders of what wee are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; Hee remembers that we are but duÅ¿t:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what is there in duÅ¿t to helpe it Å¿elfe, if God in mercy take not pitty upon it? When God lookes downe upon us, and Å¿ees how foule we are growne, whom hee Created cleane: hath he not cauÅ¿e to fall a chiding, and to be angrie, yet when he conÅ¿iders of what we are framed, and that wee are but duÅ¿t; this is Å¿ome cauÅ¿e againe, to make him leave his chiding, and not to keepe his anger for ever; that we may truly Å¿ay, Our miÅ¿eries are our happineÅ¿Å¿e: for if it be our miÅ¿erie, that we are framed of Å¿o meane a matter as DuÅ¿t; It is our happineÅ¿Å¿e, that wee have the meanneÅ¿Å¿e of our matter, for God to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16288:88"/> take into his conÅ¿ideration, and perhaps this was it; at leaÅ¿t one circumÅ¿tance that made Å¿o ill for the Angels that fell, that God could find no excuÅ¿e of their Å¿inne in their matter; the more hee conÅ¿idered of what they were framed, the more he found he had cauÅ¿e to bee angrie; and therefore no marvell, if his anger to them continue for ever.</p>
            <p>But this is every ones caÅ¿e to bee framed of DuÅ¿t; and why then Å¿hould God pitty Å¿ome, more then others, Å¿eeing they bee equally of DuÅ¿t, All? Is it not, that hee is the leÅ¿Å¿e an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie indeed, for that they are but DuÅ¿t; but yet he pitties them not, for being DuÅ¿t; but for being DuÅ¿t, and fearing him: for if they feare him not, he never pitties them, but lets them goe on in their Pride, at leaÅ¿t in their Å¿ecuritie, and make what they can of their DuÅ¿t: for they reckon upon great matters from their DuÅ¿t, and thinke they can improve it to a great heigth: but alas, what can they make of it, but to come to be graÅ¿Å¿e, at moÅ¿t to get up to be a flowre, a poore fading thing, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16288:89"/> boÅ¿ome: Alas, it is Å¿carce thought worthy to have a place upon the dunghill. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what could more be lookt for of DuÅ¿t? being Å¿o light a thing as it is; that if the wind but paÅ¿Å¿e over it; if you but blow upon it, it is preÅ¿ently Å¿cattered and gone; and the place where it was, will know it no more. And Å¿uch is Man: his flouriÅ¿hing is but as a Flowre, as quickly withered as a Flowre, and as Å¿oone cropt off from his Å¿talke as a Flowre: and alas, what good is in a flouriÅ¿hing, that ends in a withering? What happineÅ¿Å¿e in pleaÅ¿ures that have no continuance? O my Å¿oule, if thou wert thy Å¿elfe a tranÅ¿itorie thing, and wert not to continue; thou mightÅ¿t juÅ¿tly then looke after tranÅ¿itorie pleaÅ¿ures, and Å¿uch as have no continuance: but Å¿eeing thou art a Å¿ubÅ¿tance perpetuall, and immortall: O therefore looke after pleaÅ¿ures like thy Å¿elfe; pleaÅ¿ures that may laÅ¿t, and never come to the laÅ¿t, that may laÅ¿t and be durable: and not leave thee to the miÅ¿erie of <hi>Fuit Ilium, &amp; ingens gloria teucrorum:</hi> for <hi>FuiÅ¿Å¿e foelicem miÅ¿errimum eÅ¿t:</hi> To have beene happy, and not to bee; to have flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed, and now to bee withered, is the greateÅ¿t miÅ¿erie in the world. And the greater, for that once pluckt off from his Å¿talke; Once taken from the Earth, the Earth will never know him any more; Alas, it will Å¿carce take notice, that ever Å¿uch a one there was; and the <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Individuo;</hi> Å¿ome perhaps as of a man; None, as of this man: or rather, Å¿ome, as of a Name; None, as of a man. Or is it rather, that Man turned once to DuÅ¿t, his place will know him no more; for how Å¿hould it know one from another, when they are all Å¿o like? How know <hi>Dives</hi> from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when they have both the Å¿ame face? Å¿eeing Death hath but one copie to draw all her pictures by. Or is it rather that Man once turn'd to DuÅ¿t, is blowne about with every wind, from place to place; and what knowes the place, when DuÅ¿t falls upon it; whether it be the DuÅ¿t of a Prince, or of a PeaÅ¿ant; whether of a Man, or of a BeaÅ¿t? And muÅ¿t not Man then bee needes very miÅ¿erable; when Time, and place, the two beÅ¿t helpes of life doe both forÅ¿ake him? for what helpe can hee have of Time, when his dayes are but as GraÅ¿Å¿e? What help of Place, when his place denyes him, and will not know him? But O how vaine a thing is Man, to forget not onely the very matter of which he is made, but the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under which hee is made: and Å¿o to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, that God muÅ¿t bee faine to remember him of it: but much the vainer, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of it never Å¿o often, yet hee regards it never the more, but contenting himÅ¿elfe to be fading graÅ¿Å¿e, at moÅ¿t a fading flowre; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿eekes to improve his DuÅ¿t, to that true Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidneÅ¿Å¿e, which nothing but the feare of God
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16288:90"/> is able to procure, nothing but the pitty in God is able to effect.</p>
            <p>But now at laÅ¿t, if neither the DiÅ¿tances of Place, nor the Affection of Nature can make you Å¿ufficiently conceive the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods mercy: then take an expreÅ¿Å¿ing in plaine tearmes; and this will certainly make you conceive it: <hi>For his mercy is from everlaÅ¿ting, <label type="milestone">

            <p>And indeed, why elÅ¿e hath God prepared <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>19</label> his Throne in Heaven, but to the end the godly may bee aÅ¿Å¿ured, that though they bee now oppreÅ¿Å¿ed on earth; yet thither they Å¿hall come at laÅ¿t, to bee with him in Joy: to bee there in Joy, for having obeyed him: when the wicked Å¿hall bee left behind to bewayle their miÅ¿eries for not obeying him. For though his Throne be prepared onely in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>Yet his kingdome ruleth over all:</hi> Over All, both Man, and BeaÅ¿t; both the Godly, and the Wicked; both bleÅ¿Å¿ed Angells, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits; and becauÅ¿e his Kingdome ruleth over all, therefore All Å¿hall Å¿erve him, and Å¿hall Å¿erve him indeed with feare, yet there Å¿hall be a difference, for the godly Å¿hall Å¿erve him with feare and joy, where the wicked Å¿hall Å¿erve him with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>And now, Å¿eeing God hath prepared his Throne in heaven; Therefore, O yee his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, inhabitants of Heaven, that obey his Commandements by the freedome of your will; Doe you begin firÅ¿t, and prayÅ¿e his Name: <hi>for you excell in Å¿trength,</hi> and are beÅ¿t able to doe it. And Å¿eeing his Kingdome ruleth overall: Therefore all ye his HoÅ¿ts, his other Creatures that obey his Commandement too, though not by will, yet by inÅ¿tinct: Doe you Å¿econd the Angels in praiÅ¿ing his Name. And

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>1</label> Å¿o peremptorily; <hi>I will love the Lord:</hi> as though it were in his owne power to love whom he liÅ¿t? Indeed nothing is Å¿o voluntary as love, that it Å¿eemes to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the will: for then wee are Å¿aid to love a thing, when the will is inclined, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently bent upon it: and yet I know not how, there Å¿eemes nothing more conÅ¿trained then love; for we often-times love a thing, which we would faine wee could forbeare to love; but that we are drawne to love it, by a kind of violence in the object: and therefore <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:16288:94"/> may well Å¿ay; <hi>I will love the Lord:</hi> Å¿eeing both the cauÅ¿es of love are here met, a propenÅ¿ion in the Will, and an excellencie in the Object.</p>
            <p>Man indeed is naturally a loving Creature, but doth not alwayes place his love aright: his love is then beÅ¿t placed, when it is placed upon the beÅ¿t Object; and what is that beÅ¿t Object, but God? If he place it upon Beauty, that fadeth: If upon Riches, they periÅ¿h: If upon Honour, that vaniÅ¿heth: If upon life, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth: but all theÅ¿e are in God, not onely in Eminencie, but in Continuance: In him is Beautie that never fadeth: in him Riches that never periÅ¿h; in him Honour that never vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿heth; in him life, that never waÅ¿teth; and therfore as the trueÅ¿t object of love, as the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t object of my love; I will love the Lord.</p>
            <p>But though all theÅ¿e Eminencies be in God, yet they would bee no cauÅ¿e for man to love him, if they had not a relation to man: for what cauÅ¿e of love? where there can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no effects of love: but Å¿eeing there is in them, not onely a Relation, but a PropenÅ¿ion; not onely they are ready to bee imparted, but are imparted with readineÅ¿Å¿e; what man is hee that will forbeare to Å¿ay, that can forbeare to Å¿ay; <hi>I love the Lord?</hi> And if all men will forbeare to Å¿ay it, yet I will Å¿ay it: <hi>For hee hath heard my voyce, and my Å¿upplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> No doubt a juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e, or rather (indeed to a naturall man) the onely cauÅ¿e for loving of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16288:94"/> God. For of fearing him, of praiÅ¿ing him, of worÅ¿hipping him, of magnifying him, there are other cauÅ¿es; but of loving him, no cauÅ¿e Å¿o proper as his loving of us: and the Benefits which he beÅ¿towes upon us. For, love is Å¿o reciprocall a thing, that we Å¿hould hardly love God himÅ¿elfe, but for his Love to us; at leaÅ¿t for our opinion of his love to us; and wee Å¿hould hardly have an opinion of his love, if we had not a feeling of his Benefits: For what love can wee thinke is borne us by them, that are able to doe us good, and doe it not? but when we have a feeling of their benefits, and find they doe us good; then wee are eaÅ¿ily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded of their love; and being Å¿o perÅ¿wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who can chooÅ¿e but Å¿ay, as <hi>David</hi> doth here; <hi>I love the Lord for he hath heard my voyce, and my Å¿upplication?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doe we love God, but for his Benefits onely? and if it were not for his Benefits, Å¿hould we not love him? Indeed to love God as we ought, is not to love him for ought, but for himÅ¿elfe onely, without any conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had at all of his Benefits: but Å¿uch lovers wee are of our owne good, that wee Å¿hould Å¿carce love our Å¿elves, but for the good, we are ready to doe our Å¿elves: and if we love God in the like degree, we thinke it perhaps to be love enough for him. But, O my Å¿oule, this is juÅ¿t the Divells love; I meane Å¿uch love, as the Divell thought to be in <hi>Job; Doth Job love God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16288:95"/> for nought?</hi> He hoped he did not, though hee knew he Å¿hould; and therefore was never in quiet, till it might bee tryed; and if hee had found it Å¿o, he would quickly have made <hi>Job</hi> leave loving of God, and fall to loving of him. But the hedge which God had Å¿et about <hi>Job,</hi> was not a hedge of proÅ¿peritie as Sathan Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, but a hedge of Grace, and therefore with all his fierie tryalls, hee could never get other words from <hi>Job</hi> but Å¿uch as theÅ¿e; <hi>Shall we receive good at Gods hands, and Å¿hall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evill? Yes, O Lord, though thou kill mee, yet will I love thee:</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> did, and thus Å¿hould we doe: but God knowes, there is not Å¿uch a man againe as <hi>Job</hi> was upon the face of the earth. For alas, wee are commonly but of the ClaÅ¿Å¿is or forme, of which Saint <hi>John</hi> Å¿peakes; <hi>Wee love God, becauÅ¿e God loved us firÅ¿t:</hi> and it were well if we would doe but Å¿o: how much Å¿oever Sathan Å¿lights it, and Å¿eekes to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it. Or is it perhaps, that <hi>David</hi> Å¿peakes in the curioÅ¿itie of this diÅ¿tinction, that we doe not <hi>Amare Deum,</hi> but for his Benefits: but wee may <hi>Diligere Deum,</hi> without any conÅ¿ideration of his Benefits had at all; and in this Å¿enÅ¿e, a naturall man may <hi>Amare Deum:</hi> but none but the Å¿pirituall man, <hi>Diligere Deum.</hi> But, O my Å¿oule, doe thou endevour to be of <hi>Jobs</hi> forme; to love God without diÅ¿tinction; and whether he heare thy voyce, or heare it not; whether he grant thy Å¿upplication, or grant it not, yet

For it is indeed no true love of God, if wee love him for any thing, but for himÅ¿elfe; if we love our Å¿elves, but onely for him: as it Å¿eemes both <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, who for the love of God, left all care of themÅ¿elves, and were contented to have beene (if they might have beene) even Anathema's.</p>
            <p>But is this Å¿uch a Benefit to us, that GOD heares us? Is his hearing our voyce, Å¿uch an argument of his love? Alas! hee may heare us, and we never the better: hee may heare our voyce, and yet his love to us perhaps but little, for who will not give a man the hearing, though he love him not at all?

But will this be well done? May I not in Å¿o doing, doe more then I Å¿hall have thankes for perhaps for my labour? Is this the requitall that God Å¿hall have for his kindneÅ¿Å¿e in hearing me, that now he Å¿hall have a cuÅ¿tomer of me, and never be in quiet, for my continuall run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, and calling upon him? Doth God get any thing by my calling upon him, that I Å¿hould make it a Vow, as though in calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, I did him a pleaÅ¿ure? O my Soule, that God might indeed have a cuÅ¿tomer of me in praying: although I confeÅ¿Å¿e I Å¿hould not be Å¿o bold to call upon him Å¿o continually, if his owne commanding me, did not make it a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for hath not God bid me to call upon him when I am in trouble? and is there any time that I am not in trouble, as long as I live in this vale of miÅ¿erie? and then can there be any time as long as I live, that I muÅ¿t not call upon him? For Å¿hall God bid me, and Å¿hall I not doe it? Å¿hall God incline his Eare, and Å¿tand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tening to heare, and Å¿hall I hold my peace for the nonce, that he may have nothing to heare? Or Å¿hall I wave calling upon God, who I know both can, and will heare mee; and call upon Å¿ome other, who I know not whether they can or no? Is Prayer worth any thing if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16288:96"/> it bee not in Faith? and can there bee Faith, where there is uncertaintie? O my Soule, this is a great Å¿ecret, which we Å¿hould perhaps have never knowne, if God himÅ¿elfe had not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to us: that to call upon him, is not a trouble to him, but a pleaÅ¿ure; not in us a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umption, but a dutie: though it be our Å¿uite, yet it is his Å¿ervice: it is indeed both our Å¿uite and Å¿ervice: and though his glory be not the more by it, yet his glory is the more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted by it; and as he is a jealous God, Å¿o of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Å¿o much as of his glory, his glory hee will not communicate with any other, any thing elÅ¿e perhaps, but not his glory: and this is all the glory hee can have from us, that wee acknowledge our owne weakneÅ¿Å¿e, and his Power; that we call upon him, not onely as one that is able to helpe us, but as the onely One that is able to helpe us, for elÅ¿e we Å¿atisfie not his jealouÅ¿ie: and if it be a true rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophie; <hi>FruÅ¿tra fit per plura, quod fieri poteÅ¿t per pauciora:</hi> It is no leÅ¿Å¿e true in Divinitie: It is in vaine to call upon any other for reliefe but God alone; if God alone be able, and willing to relieve us. Either therefore wee muÅ¿t Å¿ay, that God is not able, or not willing to helpe us; or elÅ¿e confeÅ¿Å¿e it at leaÅ¿t a great vanitie to call for helpe to any other.</p>
            <p>But if Gods benefits be the Motive to love him: why are not his afflictions as well a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not to love him? <hi>For is there any evill in

            <p>But if it be doubted, by what meanes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and croÅ¿Å¿es doe happen to us, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted by what meanes they muÅ¿t be removed from us: Å¿eeing there is none able to rowle away the Grave-Å¿tone of our Å¿innes, but onely God: and therefore no meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move afflictions, but onely his Mercy: and no meanes of this meanes, but to call upon him.

               <hi>O Lord, I beÅ¿eech thee, deliver my Å¿oule:</hi> a Å¿hort Prayer for Å¿o great a Å¿uite; and yet as Å¿hort as it was, it prevailed, that if wee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred before at the power of God, wee may wonder now at the power of Prayer, that can prevaile with God, for obtaining of that, which in Nature is impoÅ¿Å¿ible, and to ReaÅ¿on Å¿eemes incredible.</p>
            <p>There are many Å¿hort Prayers recorded in the Scriptures, of which we may note eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally three: This of <hi>David</hi> here; <hi>O Lord deliver my Å¿oule:</hi> and that of the Publican in the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a Å¿inner:</hi> and that of the Thiefe upon the CroÅ¿Å¿e; <hi>Lord remember me, when thou commeÅ¿t into thy kingdome:</hi> All three Å¿hort, yet all three Prevalent; that wee may know, it is not the multiplicitie of words,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16288:98"/> or the length of Prayers that prevailes with God; but the fervencie of Å¿pirit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the heart. Yet leÅ¿t it Å¿hould be taken as a reÅ¿traint of longer prayers; and Å¿pecially, leÅ¿t it Å¿hould be a Å¿candall to the Prayer which ChriÅ¿t taught us, and is much longer: we may obÅ¿erve withall, that each of theÅ¿e prayers, is but of one Petition in ChriÅ¿ts Prayer: For to Å¿ay, O Lord, deliver my Å¿oule, is no more, nor fully Å¿o much, as to Å¿ay, <hi>Deliver us from evill:</hi> and to Å¿ay, Lord be mercifull to me a Å¿inner, is no more, nor fully Å¿o much, as to Å¿ay; <hi>Forgive us our treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es:</hi> and to Å¿ay, <hi>Lord remember mee, when thou commeÅ¿t into thy Kingdome;</hi> is no more, nor Å¿o much, as to Å¿ay, <hi>Thy kindome come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Å¿eeing <hi>David</hi> with his Å¿hort Prayer, prevailed with God, to deliver his Å¿oule: why Å¿hould I deÅ¿paire of the like Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e of my prayers, to be delivered from my troubles? O my Å¿oule, I Å¿hould not deÅ¿paire of the like Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿e, as <hi>David</hi> had, if I could but pray with the like Å¿pirit as <hi>David</hi> did: O therefore, thou great God, that didÅ¿t inÅ¿pire <hi>Davids</hi> heart with a Å¿pirit of zeale: which made his prayers not onely acceptable, but effectuall: vouchÅ¿afe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o to kindle in my heart, a fire of Devotion, that my prayers may aÅ¿cend unto thee, like the Å¿acrifice of <hi>Abell:</hi> Å¿o acceptable, that they may be accepted; Å¿o accepted, that they may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: and may make mee able to Å¿ing this Allelujah of <hi>David: I will love the Lord; for he

            </p>
            <p>And now, O my Å¿oule, me thinkes I Å¿ee the Lord, as it were inclining his eare unto me; and I Å¿eeme to feele an acceÅ¿Å¿e of force in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>5</label> of his goodneÅ¿Å¿e, for indeed, <hi>the Lord is gracious, and righteous; yea, our God is mercifull:</hi> Hee is gracious in hearing; Hee is righteous in judging; hee is mercifull in Pardoning; and how then can I doubt of his will to helpe me? Hee is righteous to reward according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erts; He is gracious to Reward above deÅ¿erts; Yea, he is mercifull to reward without deÅ¿erts; and how then can I doubt of his Will to helpe mee?

            <p>But are there no others that are gracious, and righteous, and mercifull, as well as Hee? Are not the Saints, and Angels in Heaven? They are Å¿o no doubt, but not as well as hee; God forbid, wee Å¿hould once have Å¿uch a thought; They are Gracious, and Righteous, and Mercifull by participation onely; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16288:99"/> onely by having, as it were, Å¿ome beames im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them: but to bee gracious, as the Fountaine of Grace; to be Righteous, as the Sunne of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e: to be Mercifull, as the Authour of Mercie; there is none, there is none at all, neither Saint nor Angell that is Å¿o, but onely God; and therefore of Gods Power and Will to helpe me; of his, and of his onely, I can onely be aÅ¿Å¿ured. And if I erre in Å¿impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, yet <hi>the Lord preÅ¿erveth the Å¿imple:</hi> he takes <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>6</label> not advantage of errours, where there is a good intention; yet not a good intention one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where the truth is manifeÅ¿t, and revealed: for then Å¿hould <hi>Uzzah</hi> have beene preÅ¿erved: but in matters obÅ¿cure, and not plainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there to Å¿erve God in Å¿implicitie of heart; this falls within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of Gods mercy: and Å¿uch he takes into his Protection. He gives them perhaps Å¿ome reÅ¿entment of their errours by worldly croÅ¿Å¿es, but yet hee denyes them not his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance; and this I can Å¿peake of my owne experience; For, <hi>I was brought low, and yet hee helped me:</hi> I was brought low, and in trouble, by the juÅ¿t provocation of my Å¿innes; but becauÅ¿e I Å¿inned not in preÅ¿umption, but in Å¿implicitie, at leaÅ¿t by infirmitie; the Lord hath had mercy on me, and preÅ¿erved me. Or, <hi>I was brought low, and hee helped mee:</hi> for then is the time of helpe, when we are brought low: and therefore God who doth all things in due time; when I was brought low, then he helped me.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16288:100"/> Wherefore, O my Å¿oule, let it never trouble thee, how low Å¿oever thou bee brought; for when thy Å¿tate is at the loweÅ¿t, then is Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance at the neereÅ¿t; that we may truly Å¿ay, Gods wayes, are not as the wayes of the world: for in the world, when a man is once brought low, he is commonly trampled upon; and nothing is heard then, but downe with him, downe to the ground: but with God, it is otherwiÅ¿e; for his propertie is to raiÅ¿e up them that fall, and when they are brought low, then to helpe them. That it is no Å¿uch hard caÅ¿e for a man to bee brought low; may I not rather Å¿ay, his caÅ¿e is happy? for is it not better to be brought low, and have God to helpe him, then to be Å¿et aloft, and left to helpe himÅ¿elfe? At leaÅ¿t, O my Body; this may bee a comfort to thee: for thou art Å¿ure to bee brought low, as low as the Grave, which is low indeed: yet there thou maieÅ¿t reÅ¿t in hope; for even there, the Lord will not leave to helpe thee.</p>
            <p>Or is it that he was brought low, was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Å¿pirit, to Å¿eeme vile in his owne eyes; and then God helped him? <hi>For God reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the proud; but giveth grace to the humble.</hi>

For indeed if we endeavour not to walke here, with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the paths of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, we Å¿hall never come to walke with God in the Land of the living.</p>
            <p>But though I had Å¿poken thus, and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently; yet I found my Å¿elfe in trouble, and affliction Å¿till, which made me Å¿ay in my haÅ¿t; <hi>All men are lyars.</hi> In my haÅ¿t indeed, for I <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>11</label> thought not of one man who was farre from being a lyar; and in whoÅ¿e mouth was found no guile.</p>
            <p>It Å¿eemes, that to give the lye, was not Å¿o heynous an offence in <hi>Davids</hi> time, as it is in theÅ¿e dayes, for elÅ¿e how durÅ¿t he have Å¿poken Å¿uch words, that <hi>all men are lyars:</hi> which is no leÅ¿Å¿e, then to give the lye to the whole world? And yet, no man I thinke, will challenge him for Å¿aying Å¿o; no more then challenge S. <hi>John</hi> for Å¿aying, that All men are Å¿inners. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, how Å¿hould any man avoid being a lyar, Å¿eeing the very being Man, is it Å¿elfe a lye? Not onely a Vanity, and put in the ballance is leÅ¿Å¿e then vanity: but a very lye, promiÅ¿ing great matters, and is able to doe juÅ¿t nothing, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith; <hi>Without me, yee can doe nothing:</hi> and Å¿o ChriÅ¿t Å¿eemes to come in, as it were, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16288:103"/> be <hi>Davids</hi> Å¿econd; and to make his word good, that <hi>all men be lyars.</hi> And now let the world doe its worÅ¿t, and take the lye how it will; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> having ChriÅ¿t of his Å¿ide, will alwayes be able to make his part good againÅ¿t all the world, for ChriÅ¿t hath overcome the world.</p>
            <p>But though all men may be Å¿aid to be lyars, yet not all men in all things: for then <hi>David</hi> himÅ¿elfe Å¿hould be a lyar in this: but all men perhaps in Å¿omething or other, at Å¿ometime or other, in Å¿ome kind or other; AbÅ¿olute truth not found in any man, but in that man onely, who was not man onely; for if hee had beene but Å¿o, it had not perhaps beene found in him neither, Å¿eeing abÅ¿olute Truth and Deitie, are as Relatives never found to be aÅ¿under.</p>
            <p>But in what thing is it, that all men Å¿hould be lyars? Indeed in this for one; to thinke that God regards not, nor loves not them, whom he Å¿uffers to be afflicted: for we may rather thinke hee loves them moÅ¿t, whom hee Å¿uffers to be moÅ¿t afflicted: and we may truly Å¿ay, he would never have Å¿uffered his Å¿ervant <hi>Job,</hi> to be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Å¿o exceeding cruelly, if he had not loved him exceeding tenderly; For there is nothing loÅ¿t by Å¿uffering afflictions; No my Å¿oule, they doe but Å¿erve to make up the greater weight of glory, when it Å¿hall be revealed.</p>
            <p>But let his afflictions be what they can be, yet I will alwayes acknowledge, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in any degree Å¿o great as his benefits:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16288:103"/> and oh, that <hi>I could thinke of Å¿omething, that I <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>12</label> might render to him for all his benefits:</hi> for Å¿hall I receive Å¿o great, Å¿o infinite benefits from him; and Å¿hall I render nothing to him, by way of gratefulneÅ¿Å¿e? But alas, what have I to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? all my rendring to him, will bee but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more from him: for all I can doe, is but <hi>to take the cup of Å¿alvation, and call upon his Name;</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>13</label> and what rendring is there in this taking? If I could take the cup of Tribulation, and drinke it off, for his Å¿ake; this perhaps might be a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of Å¿ome value: but this, God knowes is no worke for me to doe: It was his worke who Å¿aid; <hi>Can yee drinke of the cup, of which I Å¿hall drinke?</hi> Indeed he dranke of the Cup of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, to the end that wee might take the Cup of Salvation; but then in taking it, wee muÅ¿t call upon his Name; upon his Name, and upon no others; for elÅ¿e wee Å¿hall make it a cuppe of Condemnation, Å¿eeing there is no Name under Heaven, in which we may bee Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but onely the Name of JeÅ¿us.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be Å¿ome rendring to the Lord, if I pay my Vowes; and doe, as it were, my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance openly; <hi>I will therefore pay my vowes to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>14</label> the Lord, in the preÅ¿ence of all his people.</hi> But might hee not pay his Vowes as well in his CloÅ¿et, betweene God and himÅ¿elfe, as to doe it publickly? No my Å¿oule, it Å¿erves not his turne; indeed not Gods turne, but he muÅ¿t pay them in the preÅ¿ence of all his people; yet not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16288:104"/> to the end hee Å¿hould be applauded for a juÅ¿t Payer; for though he pay them, yet he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay them to the full; but to the end that men Å¿eeing his good workes, may glorifie God by his example; and the rather perhaps, for that <hi>David</hi> was a King; and the Kings exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prevailes much with the people, to make them pay their vowes to God: but moÅ¿t of all, that by this meanes, <hi>Davids</hi> Pietie may not be barren; but may make a Breed of Pietie in the people alÅ¿o: which may be one myÅ¿ticall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, why it was counted a CurÅ¿e in IÅ¿rael, to be barren; for he that payes not his Vowes to God, in the preÅ¿ence of his people, may well be Å¿aid to be barren in IÅ¿rael; Å¿eeing hee begets no children to God, by his Example. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alÅ¿o, the Vowes which <hi>David</hi> meanes here, was the doing of Å¿ome meane things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in Å¿hew for the dignitie of a King; as when it was thought a baÅ¿e thing in him to Daunce before the Arke; he then vowed he would be baÅ¿er yet: and in this caÅ¿e, to pay his Vowes before the people, becomes a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿itie: for as there is no honour to a man, whilÅ¿t he is by himÅ¿elfe alone; Å¿o there is no Å¿hame to a man, but before people: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Å¿hew that he is not aÅ¿hamed to doe any thing how meane Å¿oever, Å¿o it may tend to the glorifying of God; <hi>Hee will pay his vowes in the preÅ¿ence of all his people:</hi> And hee will doe it, though it coÅ¿t him his life, for if he dye for it,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16288:104"/> he knowes, that <hi>Pretious in the Å¿ight of the Lord, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VerÅ¿e </seg>15</label> is the death of his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which is pretious, is commonly deÅ¿ired: and doth God then deÅ¿ire the death of his Saints? He deÅ¿ires, no doubt, that death of his Saints, which is to dye to Å¿inne: but for any other death of his Saints, it is therefore Å¿aid to be pretious in his Å¿ight, becauÅ¿e hee layes it up with the greater carefulneÅ¿Å¿e. And for this it is, there are Å¿uch Å¿everall ManÅ¿ions in Gods HouÅ¿e, that to them whoÅ¿e death is pretious in his Å¿ight, hee may aÅ¿Å¿igne the moÅ¿t glorious ManÅ¿ions. This indeed is the reward of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, and the encouragement of Martyrs, though their Å¿ufferings bee moÅ¿t inÅ¿ufferable, their tortures moÅ¿t intolerable; yet this makes amends for all; that <hi>Pretious in the Å¿ight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints:</hi> for if it be Å¿o great a happineÅ¿Å¿e, to be acceptable in his Å¿ight; how great a happineÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿t it be, to bee pretious in his Å¿ight? When God at the Creation, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon all his workes; it is Å¿aid, he Å¿aw them to be all exceeding good: but it is not Å¿aid, that any of them were Pretious in his Å¿ight, and how then comes Death, to bee pretious in his Å¿ight, that was none of his workes, but is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troyer of his workes? Is it poÅ¿Å¿ible that a thing which deÅ¿troyes his creatures, Å¿hould have a Title of more value in his Å¿ight, then his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themÅ¿elves? O my Å¿oule, this is one of the Myracles of his Saints, and perhaps one of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16288:105"/> thoÅ¿e which ChriÅ¿t meant, when he Å¿aid to his ApoÅ¿tles, that greater Myracles then he did, they Å¿hould doe themÅ¿elves: for what greater Myracle than this, that Death which of it Å¿elfe is a thing moÅ¿t vile in the Å¿ight of God, yet once embraced by his Saints, as it were by their touch onely, becomes pretious in his Å¿ight? and to alter a thing from being vile to be precious; is it not a greater Myracle, then to turne Water into Wine? Indeed Å¿o it is, Death doth not damnifie his Saints, but his Saints doe dignifie Death: Death takes nothing away from his Saints happineÅ¿Å¿e, but his Saints adde luÅ¿tre to Deaths vileneÅ¿Å¿e: and it is happy for Death, that ever it met with any of Gods Saints; for there was no way for it elÅ¿e in the world, to be ever had in any account. But why Å¿ay I, in the world? for it is of no account in the world for all this: It is but onely in the Å¿ight of God; but indeed this onely, is All in All; for to be pretious in Gods Å¿ight, is more to be prized then the world it Å¿elfe. For when the World Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e away, and all the glory of it be laid in the duÅ¿t; then Å¿hall Trophyes be erected for the death of his Saints: and when all Monuments of the world Å¿hall bee utterly defaced, and all Records quite raÅ¿ed out; yet the death of his Saints Å¿hall Å¿tand RegiÅ¿tred Å¿till, in faire Red letters in the Kalendar of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for if there be glory laid up for them that dye in the Lord; much more Å¿hall they bee
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16288:105"/> glorified, that dye for the Lord.</p>
            <p>I have wondered often-times, why God will Å¿uffer his Saints to dye; I meane not the death naturall; for I know, <hi>Statutum eÅ¿t omnibus Å¿emel mori:</hi> but the Death that is by violence, and with torture: for who could endure to Å¿ee them he loves, Å¿o cruelly handled? but now I Å¿ee the reaÅ¿on of it; For, <hi>Pretious in the Å¿ight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints:</hi> and what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then, if he Å¿uffer his Saints to dye: when by dying they are wrought, and made fit Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels to be Å¿et in his Cavinet: for as God hath a Bottle which he fills up with the teares of his Saints; Å¿o I may Å¿ay, he hath a Cabinet which he decks up with the deaths of his Saints: and O my Å¿oule, if thou couldÅ¿t but comprehend, what a glory it is to Å¿erve for a Jewell in the decking up of Gods Cabinet; thou wouldÅ¿t never wonder why he Å¿uffers his Saints to bee put to death, though with never Å¿o great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for it is but the Å¿ame which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith: <hi>The afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glory that Å¿hall bee revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will have a GlaÅ¿Å¿e to view the Extent of this pretiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; and plainly to Å¿ee, how pretious in the Å¿ight of God, the death of his Saints is; then look upon the revenge that is taken for it: for there is nothing that God takes Å¿o much to heart; and of which hee takes Å¿o Å¿harpe revenge, as the death of his Saints: to touch them, is to touch the Apple of his eye:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16288:106"/> and if the puniÅ¿hment of <hi>Cain</hi> bee not thought Å¿ufficient, to make it appeare; at leaÅ¿t the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of ChriÅ¿t againÅ¿t <hi>HieruÅ¿alem,</hi> will be Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: <hi>O HieruÅ¿alem, HieruÅ¿alem; Thou that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿t the Prophets:</hi> and it is thought by Å¿ome, that the deÅ¿truction of <hi>HieruÅ¿alem</hi> was the rather haÅ¿tened, to revenge the death of <hi>James,</hi> who was called the JuÅ¿t: but how Å¿oever, this wee know, it was therefore executed, to revenge the death of <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi> who was truly the JuÅ¿t: and may we not well take notice, that the death was exceeding pretious; when the revenge that was taken, was Å¿o exceeding furious? But why Å¿peake I of Death, when I may yet doe God good Å¿ervice in life: and if the death of his Saints be pretious in his Å¿ight, certainly the life of his Å¿ervants is not unregarded; For whether we dye, wee dye to the Lord; or whether wee live, wee live to the Lord: and though in this life, we cannot expect the reward of Saints; yet in this life wee may claime the reÅ¿pect of Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and in this I claime an intereÅ¿t my Å¿elfe; <label type="milestone">
